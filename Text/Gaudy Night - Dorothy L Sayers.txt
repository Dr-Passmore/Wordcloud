AUTHOR’S NOTE 

It would be idle to deny that the City and University of Oxford (tn 
aetemumfloreant) do actually exist, and contain a number of colleges and 
other buildings, some of which are mentioned by name m this book It 
IS therefore the more necessary to affirm emphatically that none of the 
characters which I have placed upon this public stage has any counter- 
part in real life In particular, Shrewsbury College, with its dons, 
students and scouts, is entirely imaginary , nor are the distressing events 
described as taking place within its walls founded upon any events that 
have ever occurred anywhere Detective-story writers are obliged by 
their disagreeable profession to invent startling and unpleasant incidents 
and people, and are (I presume) at liberty to imagine what might happen 
if such incidents and people were to intrude upon the life of an innocent 
and well-ordered community , but in so doing they must not be supposed 
to suggest that any such disturbance ever has occurred or is ever likely 
to occur in any community in real life 

Certain apologies are, however, due from me first, to the IJmversity 
of Oxford, for having presented it with a Chancellor and Vice-Chan- 
cellor of my own manufacture and with a college of 1 50 women students, 
m excess of the limit ordained by statute Next, and with deep humility, 
to Balliol College — not only foi having saddled it with so wayward an 
alumnus as Peter Wimsey, but also for my monstrous impertinence m 
having erected Shrewsbury College upon its spacious and sacred cncket- 
ground To New College, also to Christ Church and especially to 
Qpeen’s, I apologise for the follies of certain young gentlemen, to 
Brasenose for the facetiousness of a middle-aged one, and to Magdalen 
for the embarrassing situation in which I have placed an imagmary 
pro-Proctor The Corporation Dump, on the other hand, is, or was, a 
fact, and no apology for it is due from me 
To the Principal and Fellows of my own college of Somerville, I 
tender my thanks for help generously given m questions of proctorial 
rules and general college disciplme — though they are not to be held 
responsible for details of discipline m Shrewsbury College, many of which 
I have mvented to suit my own purpose 
Persons curious in chronology may, if they like, work out from what 
they already know of the Wimsey family tliat the action of the book 
takes place in 1935 , but if they do, they must not be querulously indig- 
nant because the King’s Jubilee is not mentioned, or because I have 
arranged the weather and the moon’s changes to suit my own fancy* 
For, however realistic the background, the novelist’s only native country 
is Qoud-Cuckooland, where they do but jest, poison in jest no offence 
in the world.

CHAPTER I 


Thou blind man^s mark, thou fooPs self-chosen snare. 

Fond fancy’s scum, and dregs of scattered thought. 

Band of all evils , cradle of causeless care, 

Thou web of will, whose end is never wrought 
Desire 1 Desire ’ I have too dearly bought 
With price of mangled mind, thy worthless ware 

SIR PHILIP SIDNEY 

Harriet Vane sat at her wntmg-table and stared out mto Mecklenburg 
Square The late tulips made a brave show m the Square garden, and a 
quartet of early tennis-players were energetically calling the score of a 
rather erratic and unpractised game But Harriet saw neither tulips nor 
tennis-players A letter lay open on the blotting-pad before her, but its 
image had faded from her nund to make way for another picture She 
saw a stone quadrangle, built by a modern architect m a style neither 
new nor old, but stretching out reconciling hands to past and present. 
Folded withm its walls lay a trim grass plot, with flower-beds splashed 
at the angles, and surrounded by a wide stone plinth Behind the level 
roofs of Gotswold slate rose the bnck clumneys of an older and less 
formal pile of bmldings — ^a quadrangle also of a kind, but still keeping 
a domestic remembrance of the origmal Victonan dwelling-houses that 
had sheltered the first shy students of Shrewsbury College, In front were 
the trees of Jowett Walk and, beyond them, a jumble of ancient gables 
and the tower of New College, with its jackdaws wheeling against a 
wmdy sky 

Memory peopled the quad with moving figures. Students sauntering 
in pairs Students dashing to lectures, their gowns hitched humedly 
over hght summer frocks, the wind jerking their flat caps mto the 
absurd likeness of so many jesters’ cockscombs Bicycles stacked in the 
porter’s lodge, their carriers piled with books and gowns twisted about 
their handlebars A grizzled woman don crossing the turf with vague 
eyes, her thoughts nveted upon aspects of sixteenth-century philosophy, 
her sleeves floating, her shoulders cocked to the academic angle that 
automatically compensated the backward drag of the pleated poplin 
Two male commoners in search of a coach, bareheaded, hands in their 
trouscrs-pockets, talkmg loudly about boats The Warden — grey and 
statcly---and the Dean— stocky, brisk, bird-like, a Lesser Redpoll — m 
animated conference under the archway leading to the Old Quadrangle.

Tall spikes of delphinium against the grey, quivenngly blue-like flames, 
if flame were ever so blue The college cat, preoccupied and remote, 
stalkmg with tail erect in the direction of the buttery 

It was all so long ago , so closely encompassed and complete , so cut 
off as by swords from the bitter years that lay between Could one face 
it now ^ What would those women say to her, to Harriet Vane, who had 
taken her First m English and gone to London to write mystery fiction, 
to live with a man who was not married to her, and to be tned for his 
murder amid a roar of notoriety ^ That was not the kmd of career that 
Shrewsbury expected of its old students 

She had never gone back , at first, because she had loved the place too 
well, and a clean break seemed better than a slow wrenching-away , 
and also because, when her parents had died and left her penniless, the 
struggle to earn a livehhood had absorbed all her time and thought And 
afterwards, the stark shadow of the gallows had fallen between her and 
that sun-drenched quadrangle of grey and green But now ^ 

She picked up the letter again It was an urgent entreaty that she 
should attend the Shrewsbury Gaudy — an entreaty of the kmd that it 
IS difficult to disregard A friend whom she had not seen smce they went 
down together , married now and remote from her, but fallen sick, 
and eager to see Hamet once again before going abroad for a 
delicate and dangerous operation 

Mary Stokes, so pretty and dainty as Miss Patty m the Second-Year 
play , so charming and fimshed m manner , so much the social 
centre of her year It had seemed strange that she should take such 
a fancy to Harriet Vane, rough and gawky and anything but generally 
popular Mary had led and Harriet had followed , when they punted 
up the Cher with strawberries and thermos flasks, when they climbed 
Magdalen tower together before sunrise on May Day and felt it swmg 
beneath them with the swing of the reeling bells , when they sat up late 
at night over the fire with coffee and parkin, it was always Mary who 
took the lead m all the long discussions about love and art, religion and 
citizenship Mary, said all her friends, was marked for a First ; only the 
dim, inscrutable dons had not been surprised when the lists came out 
with Harriet’s name in the First Glass and Mary*s m the Second* And 
since then, Mary had married and scarcely been heard of, except that 
she haunted the College with a sick persistence, never missing an Old 
Students’ Meetmg or a Gaudy But Harriet had broken all her old ties 
and half the commandments, dragged her reputation m the dust and 
made money, had the nch and amusmg Lord Peter Wimsey at her feet, 
to marry him if she chose, and was full of energy and bitterness and the 
uncertain rewards of fame Prometheus and Epimetheus had changed 
their parts, it seemed , but for one there was the box of troubles and for 
the offier the bare rock and the vulture , and never, it seemed to Hamet, 
could they meet on any common ground agam,

** But, by God * ” said Harnet, “ I won*t be a coward 1^11 go and be 
damned to it Nothing can hurt me worse than IVe been hurt already. 
And what does it matter after all ^ ** 

She filled up her invitation form, addressed it, stamped it with a sharp 
thump and ran quickly down to drop it in the pillar-box before she 
changed her mind 

She came back slowly across the Square garden, mounted the Adam 
stone stair to her flat and, after a fruitless rummage in a cupboard, came 
out and climbed up slowly again to a landing at the top of the house 
She dragged out an ancient trunk, unlocked it and flung back the lid 
A close, cold odour Books Discarded garments Old shoes Old manu- 
scripts A faded tie that had belonged to her dead lover — ^how horrible 
that that should still be hanging about * She burrowed to the bottom of 
the pile and dragged a thick, black bundle out into the dusty sunlight. 
The gown, worn only once at the taking of her M A degree, had 
suffered nothing from its long seclusion the stiflf folds shook loose with 
hardly a crease The crimson silk of the hood gleamed bravely Only 
the flat cap showed a little touch of the moth’s tooth As she beat the 
loose fluff from it, a tortoise-shell butterfly, disturbed from its hibernation 
beneath the flap of the trunk-lid, fluttered out into the brightness of the 
wmdow, where it was caught and held by a cobweb 


Harnet was glad that in these days she could afford her own little car 
Her entry into Oxford would bear no resemblance to those earlier 
arrivals by tram For a few hours longer she could ignore the whimper- 
ing ghost of her dead youth and tell herself that she was a stranger and 
a sojourner, a well-to-do woman with a position in the world The hot 
road spim away behind her , towns rose from the green landscape, 
crowded close about her with their mn-signs and petrol-pumps, their 
shops and police and perambulators, then reeled back and were for- 
gotten June was dying among the roses, the hedges were darkening to a 
duller green , the blatancy of red brick sprawled along the highway was 
a reminder that the present biulds inexorably over the empty fields of 
the past She lunched in High Wycombe, solidly, comfortably, ordering 
a half-bottle of white wine and tipping the waitress generously. She was 
eager to distmguish herself as sharply as possible from that former 
undergraduate who would have had to be content with a packet of 
sandwiches and a flask of coffee beneath the bough in a by-lane As one 
grew older, as one established one’s self, one gained a new dehght in 
formahty Her dress for the Garden-party, chosen to combine suitably 
with full academicals, lay, neatly folded, mside her suit-case It was long 
and severe, of plain black georgette, wholly and unimpeachably correct 
Beneath it was an evemng dress for the Gaudy Dinner, of a nch petunia 
colour, excellently cut on restrained lines, with no imbecoming display 



of back or breast ; it would not affront the portraits of dead Wardens, 
gazing down from the slowly mellowing oak of the Hall 
Headmgton* She was very near now, and m spite of herself a chill 
qualm cramped her stomach Headington Hill, up which one had toiled 
so often, pushing a decrepit bicycle It seemed less steep now, as one made 
decorous descent behind four rhythmically pulsating cylinders , but 
every leaf and stone hailed one with the intrusive famihanty of an old 
school-fellow Then the narrow street, with its cramped, untidy shops, 
like the mam street of a village , one or two stretches had been widened 
and improved, but there was little real change to take refuge in 
Magdalen Bridge Magdalen Tower- And here, no change at all^ — 
only the heartless and indifferent persistence of man’s handiwork- Here 
one must begin to steel one’s self m earnest Long Wall Street- St Cross 
Road The iron hand of the past gripping at one’s entrails The college 
gates , and now one must go through with it 
There was a new porter at the St Cross lodge, who heard Harriet’s 
name unmoved and checked it off upon a list She handed him her bag, 
took her car round to a garage m Mansfield Lane,* and then, with her 
gown over her arm, passed through the New Quad into the Old, and so, 
by way of an ugly brick doorway, into Burleigh Buildmg 
She met nobody of her year m the comdors or on the staircase Three 
contemporaries of a far semor generation were greeting one another 
with effusive and belated girlishness at the door of the Jumor Common 
Room , but she knew none of them, and went by unspeakmg and 
unspoken to, like a ghost. The room allotted to her she recogmsed, after 
a little calculation, as one that had been occupied m her day by a woman 
she particularly disliked, who had married a missionary and gone to 
China The present owner’s short gown hung behind the door , judging 
by the bookshelves, she was reading History ; judging by her personal 
belongings, she was a Fresher with an urge for modernity and very httie 
natural taste- The narrow bed, on which Hamet flung down her 
belongings, was covered with drapery of a crude green colour and 
ilLconsidcred Futuristic pattern , a bad picture m the neo-^archaic 
manner hung above it , a chromium-plated lamp of angular and 
inconvenient design swore acidly at the table and ward-robe 
provided by the college, which were of a style usually associated 
with the Tottenham Court Road , while the disharmony was crowned 
and accentuated by the presence, on the chest of drawers, of a curious 
statuette or three-dimensional diagram earned out in alummium, which 
resembled a gigantic and contorted corkscrew, and was labelled upon 
Its base • aspiration It was with surpnsc and relief that Hamet dis-

Mansfield Road to St Cross Road, behind Shrewsbury College and some* 
where about the junction between the Balliol and Merton Cricket grounds as 
they stand at present 
xo 



covered three practicable dress-hangers in the wardrobe* The looking- 
glass, m conformity with established college use, was about a foot square, 
and hung m the darkest corner of the room 

She unpacked her bag, took off her coat and skirt, slipped on a 
dressing-gown and set out in search of a bathroom She had allowed her- 
self three-quarters of an hour for changing, and Shrewsbury’s hot-water 
system had always been one of its most admirable minor efficiencies 
She had forgotten exactly where the bathrooms were on this floor, but 
surely they were round here to the left A pantry, two pantries, with 
notices on the doors no washing-up to be done after i i p m , three 
lavatories, with notices on the doors kindly extinguish the light 
WHEN LEAVING , ycs, here she was — ^four bathrooms, with notices on the 
doors * NO baths to be taken after i i pm, and, underneath, 
an exasperated addendum to each if students persist in takino 
baths after 1 1 p m the bathrooms will be locked at io 30 pm 
SOME consideration for others is necessary in community life. 
Signed L. Martin, Dean Harriet selected the largest bathroom It 
contained a notice regulations in case of fire, and a card pnnted in 
large capitals the supply of hot water is limited* please avoid 
UNDUE WASTE With a familiar sensation of being under authonty, 
Hamet pushed down the waste-plug and turned on the tap The water 
was boding, though the bath badly needed a new coat of enamel and the 
cork mat had seen better days 

Once bathed, Harriet felt better. She was lucky again m returning to 
her room to meet no one whom she knew She was in no mood for 
remimscent gossipmgs in dressing-gowns She saw the name Mrs 
Attwood ” on the door next but one to hers The door was shut, and 
she was grateful The next door bore no name, but as she went by, 
someone turned the handle from withm, and it began to open slowly. 
Harriet leapt quickly past it and into shelter. She found her heart 
beating absurdly fast. 

The black frock fitted her like a glove It was made with a small square 
yoke and long, close sleeves, softened by a wnst-fnll falling nearly to the 
knuckles It outlined her figure to the waist and fell full-skirted to the 
ground, with a suggestion of the mediaeval robe Its dull surface effaced 
Itself, not outshimng the dull gleam of the academic poplin. She pulled 
the gown’s heavy folds forward upon her shoulders, so ffiat the straight 
fronts fell stole-wise, serene The hood cost her a small struggle, before 
she remembered the right twist at the throat which turned the bright 
silk outwards She pinned it invisibly on her breast, so that it sat poised 
and balanced — one black shoulder and one crimson Standing and 
stoopmg before the inadequate looking-glass (the present student who 
owned the room was obviously a very short woman), she adjusted the 
soft cap to he flat and straight, peak down in the centre of the forehead. 
The glass showed her her own face, rather pale, with black brows front- 

XX 



mg squarely either side of a strong nose, a little too broad for beauty. 
Her own eyes looked back at her— rather tired, rather defiant— eyes 
that had looked upon fear and were still wary The mouth was the 
mouth of one who has been generous and repented of generosity , its 
wide corners were tucked back to give nothing awav With the thick, 
waving hair folded beneath the black cloth, the face seemed somehow 
stripped for action She frowned at herself and moved her hands a little 
up and down upon the stuff of her gown , then, becoming impatient 
with the looking-glass, she turned to the window, which looked out into 
the Inner or Old Quad This indeed, was less a quad than an oblong 
garden, with the college buildings grouped about it At one end, tables 
and chairs were set out upon the grass beneath the shade of the trees 
At the far side, the new Library wing, now almost complete, showed its 
bare rafters in a forest of scaffolding A few gioups of women crossed the 
lawn , Harriet observed with irritation that most of them wore their 
caps badly, and one had had the folly to put on a pale lemon frock with 
muslin frills, which looked incongruous beneath a gown 

“ Though, after ail,” she thought, “ the bright colours are mediaeval 
enough And at any rate, the women are no worse than the men I once 
saw old Hammond walk in the Encaenia procession m a Mus Doc gown, 
a grey flannel suit, brown boots and a blue spotted tie, and nobody said 
anything to him ” 

She laughed suddenly, and for the first tune felt confident. 

They can’t take this away, at any rate Whatever I may have done 
since, this remains Scholar , Master of Arts , Domina , Senior Member 
of this University {statutum est quod Jmiores Senionhus debitam et congruam 
rementtam turn in pnvato turn m publico exhibeant) , a place achieved, 
inalienable, worthy of reverence ” 

She walked firmly from the room and knocked upon the door next but 
one to her own 

• # • • « , 

The four women walked dovm to the garden together — slowly, because 
Mary was ill and could not move fast. And as they went, Harriet was 
thinking • 

** It’s a mistake— It’s a great mistake— I shouldn’t have come Mary 
is a dear, as she always was, and she is pathetically pleased to see me, but 
we have nothing to say to one another. And I shall always remember 
her, now, as she is to-day, with that haggard face and look of defeat And 
she will remember me as I am — hardened She told me I looked 
successful I know what that means ” 

She was glad that Betty Armstrong and Dorothy Golhns were domg 
all the talking One of them was a hardworking dog-breeder , the other 
ran a bookshop in Manchester They had evidently kept m touch with 
one another, for they were discussing things and not people, as those do 
who have lively interests in common Mary Stokes (now Mary Attwood) 



seemed cut off* from them, by sickness, by marriage, by — it was no use 
to blink the truth — by a land of mental stagnation that had nothing to 
do with cither illness or marriage I suppose,” thought Harriet, “ she 
had one of those small, summery brains, that flower early and run to 
seed Here she is^ — ^my intimate friend — talking to me with a painful kind 
of admiring pohteness about my books And I am talking with a painful 
kind of admiring politeness about her children We ought not to have 
met again It’s awful ” 

Dorothy Collins broke in upon her thoughts by asking her a question 
about publishers’ contracts, and the reply to this tided them over till 
they emerged into the quad A brisk figure came bustling along the path, 
and stopped with a cry of welcome 

“ Why, It’s Miss Vane • How nice to see you after all this long time.” 

Harriet thankfully allowed herself to be scooped up by the Dean, for 
whom she had always had a ver>^ great affection, and who had written 
kindly to her in the days when a cheerful kindliness had been the most 
helpful thing on earth The other three, mindful of reverence toward 
authority, passed on , they had paid their respects to the Dean earlier in 
the afternoon 

“ It was splendid that you were able to come ” 

Rather brave of me, don’t you think ^ ” said Harriet 

“ Oh, nonsense * ” said the Dean She put her head on one side and 
fixed Harriet with a bright and bird-like eye ‘‘ You mustn’t think about 
all that Nobody bothers about it at all We’re not nearly such dried-up 
mummies as you think After all, it’s tlie work you are doing that really 
counts, isn’t it ^ By the way, the Warden is longing to see you. She 
simply loved The Sands of Crime Let’s see if we can catch her before the 
Vice-Chancellor arrives How did you think Stokes was looking 
— ^Attwood, I mean ^ I never can remember all their married names ” 

“ Pretty rotten, I’m afraid,” said Hamct, ‘‘ I came here to see her, 
really, you know — but I’m afraid it’s not going to be much of a success ” 

“ Ah * ” said the Dean “ She’s stopped growing, I expect. She was a 
friend of vours — but I always thought she had a head like a day-old 
chick Very precocious, but no staying power However, I hope they’ll 
put her right Bother this wind — I can’t keep my cap down. You 
manage yours remarkably well , how do you do it ^ And I notice that 
we are both decently subfusc Have you seen Trimmer in that frightful 
frock like a canai7 lampshade ? ” 

That was Trimmer, was it ^ What’s she doing ^ ” 

Oh, lord * my dear, she’s gone m for mental healing Brightness and 
love and all that , Ah * I thought we should find the Warden 
here ” 

Shrewsbury College had been fortunate in its wardens In the early 
days, it had been digmfied by a woman of position , in the difficult 
period when it fought for Women’s Degrees it had been guided by a 

3E3 



diplomat , and now tliat it was received into the University^ its be- 
haviour was made acceptable by a personality Dr Margai et Banng wore 
her scarlet and french grey with an air She was a magnificent figure- 
head on all public occasions, and she could soothe with tact the wounded 
breasts of crusty and affronted male dons She gieeted Harriet gra- 
ciously, and asked what she thought of the new Library Wing, which 
would complete the North side of the Old Quad Harriet duly admired 
what could be seen of its proportions, said it would be a great 
improvement, and asked when it would be finished 
“ By Easter, we hope Perhaps we shall see >ou at the Opening ** 
Harriet said politely that she should look forward to it, and, seeing 
the Vice-Chancellor’s gown flutter into sight m the distance, drifted 
tactfully away to join the mam throng of old students 
Gowns, gowns, gowns It was difficult sometimes to recognise people 
after ten years or moie That m the blue-and-rabbitskm hood must be 
Sylvia Drake — ^she had taken that B Litt at last, then Miss Drake’s 
B Litt had been the joke of the college, it had taken her so long , she 
was continually rewriting her thesis and despairing over it She would 
hardly remember Harriet, who was so much her junior, but Harriet 
remembered her well —always popping in and out of the J G R during 
her year of residence, and chattering away about mediaeval Courts of 
Love Heavens ’ Here was that awful woman, Muriel Campshott, coming 
up to claim acquaintance Campshott had always simpered She still 
simpered And she w^as dressed in a shoebng shade of green She was 
going to say, “ How do you think of all your plots ^ ” She did say it 
Curse the woman And Vera Mollison She was asking . “ Arc you 
writing anything now ^ ” 

" Yes, certainly,” said Hamct “ Are you still teaching ^ ” 

** Yes — still in the same place,” said Miss Mollison Fm afraid my 
doings arc very small beer compared with yam's ” 

As there was no possible answer to this but a deprecating laugh, 
Harriet laughed deprecatmgly A movement took place People were 
drifting into the New Quad, where a Presentation Clock was to be 
unveiled, and taking up their positions upon the stone plinth that ran 
round behind the flower-beds* An official voice was heard exhorting 
the guests to leave a path for the procession Harriet used this excuse to 
disentangle herself from Vera Mollison and establish herself at the back 
of a group, all of whose faces were strange to her On the opposite side 
of the Quad she could see Mary Attwood and her friends They were 
waving She waved back She was not going to cross the grass and jom 
them She would remain detached, a umt in an offiaa! crowd 
From behind a drapery of bunting the clock, anticipating its official 
appearance in public, chimed and struck three Footsteps crunched along 
the gravel The procession came into sight beneath the archway 5 a 
small crocodile-walk of elderly people, dressed with the incongruous 
14 



brilliance of a more sumptuous era, and moving with the slovenly 
dignity charactenstic of university functions in England They ciossed 
the quad , they mounted the plinth beneath the clock , the male dons 
removed their Tudor bonnets and mortar-boards in deference to the 
Vice-Chancellor , the female dons adopted a reverential attitude sug- 
gestive of a prayer-meeting In a thin, delicate voice, the Vice-Chancel- 
lor began to speak He spoke of the history of the college , he made a 
graceful allusion to achievements which could not be measured by the 
mere passing of time , he cracked a dry and nutty little jest about rela- 
tivity and adorned it with a classical tag , he referred to the generosity 
of the donor and the beloved personality of the deceased Member of 
Council in whose memory the clock was presented , he expressed himself 
happy to unveil this handsome clock, which would add so greatly to the 
beauty of the quadrangle — a quadrangle, he would add, which, although 
a new-comei in point of time, was fully worthy to take its place among 
those ancient and noble buildings which were the glory of our Uni- 
versity In the name of the Chancellor and University of Oxford, he now 
unveiled the clock His hand went out to the rope , an agitated expres- 
sion came over the face of the Dean, resolving itself into a wide smile of 
triumph when the drapery fell away without any unseemly hitch or 
disaster , the clock was revealed, a few bold spirits started a round of 
applause , the Warden, in a short, neat speech, thanked the Vice- 
Chanceilor for his kindness in coming and his friendly expressions , the 
golden hand of the clock moved on, and the quarter-chime rang out 
mellowly The assembly heaved a sigh of satisfaction , the procession 
collected itself and made the return journey through the areWay, and 
the ceremony was happily over 

Harriet, following with the throng, discovered to her horror that Vera 
Molhson had bobbed up again beside her, and was saying she supposed 
all mystery-writers must feel a strong personal interest in clocks, as so 
many alibis turned upon clocks and time-signals There had been a 
curious incident one day at the school where she taught , it would, she 
tiiought, make a splendid plot for a detective-story, for anybody who 
was clever enough to work such things out She had been longing to see 
Harriet and tell her all about it Planting herself firmly on the lawn of 
the Old Quad, at a considerable distance from tlie lefreshment-tables, 
she began to retail the curious incident, which required a good deal of 
preliminary explanation A scout advanced, carrying cups of tea 
Harriet secured one, and instantly wished she hadn’t , it prevented 
swift movement, and seemed to nail her to Miss Mollison’s side to all 
ctenuty Then, with a heart-liftmg surge of thankfulness, she saw Phoebe 
Tucker Good old Phoebe, looking exactly the same as ever She excused 
herself hurriedly to Miss Molhson, begging that she might hear the clock 
incident at a more leisured moment, made her way through a bunch of 
gowns and said, ** Hullo ! ’’ 


15 



“ Hullo ^ ’’ said Phoebe “ Oh, it’s you Thank God * I was beginning 
to think there wasn’t a soul of our year here, except Ti^mmer and that 
ghastly Molhson female Gome and get some sandvMchcs , they he quite 
good, strange to say How are you these divs , fiouiishing ^ ” 

“ Not too bad ” 

** You re domg good stulT, anyhow ” 

So are you Let’s find something to sit upon I want to heat all about 
the digging ” 

Phoebe Tucker was a History student, who had maiiied an aicha;- 
ologist, and the combination seemed to work lemaikably well They 
dug up bones and stones and pottery in forgotten coineis of the globe, 
and wrote pamphlets and lectured to learned societies At odd moments 
they had produced a trio of cheerful >oungsters, whom they dumped 
casually upon delighted grandpaients before hastening back to the bones 
and stones 

“ Well, we’ve only just got back from Ithaca Bob is fearfully excited 
about a new set of burial-places, and has evolved an entiiely original 
and revolutionary theory about funerary rites He’s wilting a paper that 
contradicts all old Lambard’s conclusions, and I’m helping by toning 
down his adjeemes and putting in deprecatory footnotes I mean, 
Lambard may be a perverse old idiot, but it’s more dignified not to say 
so in so many words* A bland and deadly courtesy is more devastating 
don’t you think ^ ” 

“ Infinitely ” 

Here at any rate was somebody who had not altered by a hair’s- 
breadth, in spite of added years and marriage Harriet was in a mood to 
be glad of that After an exhaustive inquiry into the matter of funerary 
rites, she asked after the family 

Oh, they’re getting to be rather fun Richard — tliat’s the eldest — 

15 thnlled by the burial-places His grandmother was horrified the other 
day to find him very patiently and correctly excavating the gardenei ’$ 
rubbish-heap and making a collection of bones Her generation always 
get so agitated about germs and dirt* I suppose ihey’ie quite right, but 
the offspring doesn’t seem any the worse So his father gave him a cabinet 
to keep the bones in Simply encouraging him, Mother said I think we 
shall have to take Richard out with us next time, only Mother would be 
so worried, thinking about no drainage and what he might pick up from 
the Greeks All the children seem to be coming out quite intelligent, 
thank goodness It would have been such a bore to be the mother of 
morons, and it’s an absolute toss-up, isn’t it ^ If one could only invent 
them, like characters in books, it would be much more satisfactory to a 
well-regulated mind ” 

From this the conversation naturally passed to biology, Mendelian 
factors and Brave New World It was cut short by the emergence of 
Harriet’s former tutor from a crowd of old students Harriet and Pheebe

made a concerted rush to greet her Miss Lydgate’s manner was exactly 
what It had always been To the innocent and candid eyes of that great 
scholar, no moral problem seemed ever to present itself Of a scrupulous 
personal integrity, she embraced the irrcgularitieb of other people m a 
wide, unquesnoning charity As any student of literature must, she knew 
all the sins of the world by name, but it was doubtful whether she 
recognised them when she met them m real life It was as though a mis- 
demeanour committed by a person she knew disarmed and disin- 
fected by the contact So many young people had passed through her 
hands, and she had found so much good in all of them , it was impossible 
to think that they could be deliberately wicked, like Richard III or lago 
Unhappy, yes , misguided, yes , exposed to difhcult and complicated 
temptations which Miss Lydgate herself had been mercifully spared, 
yes If she heard of a theft, a aivorce, even worse things, she would knit 
puzzled brows and think how utteily wretched the offenders must have 
been before they could do so dreadful a thing Only once had Harriet 
ever heard her speak with unqualified disapproval of any one she knew, 
and that was of a former pupil of her ovm who had written a popular 
book about Carlyle “ No research at all,” had been Miss Lydgate’s 
verdict, ‘‘ and no effort at critical judgment She has reproduced all the 
old gossip without troubling to verify anything Slipshod, showy, and 
catchpenny T am really ashamed of her ” And even tlien she had added 
“ But I believe, poor thing, she is very hard up ” 

Miss Lydgate showed no signs of being ashamed of Miss Vane On the 
contrary, she greeted her warmly, begged her to come and see her on 
Sunday morning, spoke appreciatively of her work, and commended 
her for keeping up a scholarly standard of English, even in mystery 
fiction 

“ You gi\e a lot of pleasure in the SCR,” she added, “ and I 
believe Miss de Vine is also a fervent admirer of yours ” 

** Miss de Vine ^ ” 

** Ah, of course, you don’t know her Our new Research Fellow She’s 
such a nice person, and I know she wants to talk to you about your 
books You must come and make her acquaintance We’ve got her for 
three years, you know That is, she only comes into residence next term, 
but she’s been living in Oxford for the last few weeks, working m Bodley. 
She’s doing a great work on National Finance under the Tudors, and 
makes it perfectly fascinating, even for people like me, who arc stupid 
about money We are all so glad that the College decided to offer her the 
Jane Barraclough Fellowship, because she is a most distinguished 
scholar, and has had rather a hard time ” 

** I think I’ve heard of her Wasn’t she Head of one of the big 
provincial colleges ^ ” 

Yes , she was Provost of Flamborough for three years , but it wasn’t 
really her job , too much admimstiation, though of course she was 

I? 



marvellous on the financial side. But she was doing too much, what with 
her own work, and examining for doctorates and so on, and coping with 
students— the University and the College between them wore her out 
She’s one of those people who always will give of her best , but I think 
she found all the personal contacts uncongenial She got lil, and had to 
go abroad for a couple of years In fact, she has only just got back to 
England Of course, having to give up Flamborough made a good deal 
of difference from the financial point of \iew , so it’s nice to think that 
for the next three years she’ll be able to get on with nei book and not 
worry about that side of things ” 

“ I remember about it now,” said Harriet , “ I saw the election 
announced somewhere or other, last Christmas or thereabouts ” 

“ I expect you saw it m the Shrewsbury Year-Book We are naturally 
very proud to have her here She ought really to have a professorship, 
but I doubt if she could stand the tutorial side of it The fewer distrac- 
tions she has, the better, because she’s one of the real scholars There she 
IS, over there — and, oh, dear • I’m afraid she’s been caught by Miss 
Gubbins, You remember Miss Gubbins ^ ” 

** Vaguely,” said Phoebe “ She was Third Year when we were 
freshers An excellent soul, but rather earnest, and an appalling bore at 
College Meetings ” 

“ She is a very conscientious person,” said Miss Lydgate, “ but she has 
rather an unfortunate knack of making any subject sound dull It’s a 
great pity, because she is exceptionally sound and dependable However, 
that doesn’t greatly matter in her present appointment , slie holds a 
hbrananship somewhere — Miss Hillyard would remember where — and 
I beheve she’s researching on the Bacon family She’s such a hard 
worker But I’m afraid she’s putting poor Miss de Vine through a cross- 
examination, which doesn’t seem quite fair on an occasion like this 
Shall we go to the rescue ? ” 

As Harriet followed Miss Lydgate across the lawn, she was visited by 
an enormous nostalgia If only one could come back to this quiet place, 
where only intellectual achievement counted , if one could work here 
steadily and obscurely at some close-knit piece of leasomng, undistracted 
and uncorrupted by agents, contracts, publishers, blurb-writers, inter- 
viewers, fan-mail, autograph-hunters, notoriety-hunters, and com- 
petitors ; abolishing personal contacts, personal spites, personal 
jealousies, getting one’s teeth mto something dull and durable ; maturing 
into sohdity like the Shrewsbury beeches — then, one might be able to 
forget the wreck and chaos of the past, or see it, at any rate, in a truer 
proportion Because, in a sense, it was not important The fact that one 
had loved and sinned and suffered and escaped death w^as of far less 
ultimate moment than a single footnote in a dim academic journal 
establishing the priority of a manusenpt or restoring a lost iota subscript. 
It was the hand-to-hand struggle with the insistent personalities of other 
iB 



people, all pushing foi a place in the hmehght, that made the accidents 
of one’s own personal adventure bulk so large in the scheme of things 

But she doubted whether she were now capable of any such with- 
drawal She had long ago taken the step that put the grey-walled 
paradise of Oxford behind her No one can bathe in the same river twice, 
not even m the Isis She would be impatient of that narrow serenity — 
or so she told herself 

Pulling her wandering thoughts together, she found herself being 
introduced to Miss de Vine And, looking at her, she saw at once that 
here was a scholar of a kind very unlike Miss Lydgate, for example, and 
still more grotesquely unlike anything that Harriet Vane could ever 
become Here was a fighter, indeed , but one to whom the quadrangle 
of Shrewsbury was a native and proper arena a soldier knowing no 
personal loyalties, whose sole allegiance was to the fact A Miss Lydgate, 
standing serenely untouched by the world could enfold it in a genial 
warmth of chanty , this woman, with infimtely more knowledge of the 
world, would rate it at a just value and set it out of her path if it incom- 
moded her The thm, eager face, with its large grey eyes deeply set and 
luminous behind thick glasses, was sensitive to impressions , but behind 
that sensitiveness was a mind as hard and immovable as granite As the 
Head of a woman’s college she must, thought Harriet, have had a dis- 
tasteful task , for she looked as though the word “ compromise ” had 
been omitted from her vocabulary , and all statesmanship is compromise 
She would not be likely to tolerate any waverings of purpose or woolii- 
ness of judgment If anything came between her and the service of truth, 
she would walk over it without rancour and without pity — even if it 
were her own reputation A formidable woman when pursuing the end 
in view — and the more so, for the deceptive moderation and modesty 
she would display in dealing with any subject of which she was not 
master As they came up, she was saying to Miss Gubbins 

“ I entirely agree that a historian ought to be precise m detail ; but 
unless you take all the characters and circumstances concerned into 
account, you are reckoning without the facts The proportions and 
relations of things are just as much facts as the things themselves ; and 
if you get those wrong, you falsify the picture really seriously.” 

Here, just as Miss Gubbins, with a mulish look in her eye, was pre- 
paring to expostulate. Miss de Vme caught sight of the English tutor and 
excused herself Miss Gubbins was obliged to withdraw , Harnet 
observed with regret that she had untidy hair, an ill-kept skm and a 
large white safety-pm securmg her hood to her dress 

** Dear me ♦ ” said Miss de Vme, ** who is that very uninspired young 
woman ^ She seems very much annoyed with my review of Mr Winter- 
lake’s book on Essex She seems to think I ought to have tom the poor 
man to pieces because of a tnfiing error of a few months mad6 m dealing, 
quite incidentally, with the early history of the Bacon family. She 

X9 



attachea no importance to the fact that the book is the most illumiratmg 
and scholarly handling to date of the interactions of two most enigmatic 
characters ” 

“ Bacon family history is her subject,” said Miss Lydgate, “ so Fve 
no doubt she feels strongly about it ” 

“ It’s a great mistake to see one’s own subject out of pioportion to its 
background The error should be corrected, of couise , I did correct it — 
in a pnvatc letter to the author, which is the proper medium for tnflmg 
corrections But the man has, I feel sure got hold of the master-key to 
the situation between those two men, and in so doing he has got hold of 
a fact of genuine importance ” 

** Well,” said Miss Lydgate, showing hei strong teeth m a genial gnn, 
“ you seem to have taken a strong line wnth Miss Gubbms Now Fve 
brought along somebody I know you’re anxious to meet This is Miss 
Harriet Vane — also an artist in the relating of details ” 

** Miss Vane ^ ” The histoiian bent her bniliant, short-sighted eyes 
on Harriet, and her face lit up “ This is delightful Do let me say how 
much I enjoyed vour last book I thought it quite the best thing you’d 
done — though of course I’m not competent to form an opinion from the 
scientific point of view I wa^ discussing it with Professor Higgins, who 
IS quite a devotee of yours, and he said it suggested a most interesting 
possibility, which had not before occurred to him He wasn’t quite sure 
whether it would work, but he would do his best to find out Tell me, 
what did you have to go upon ^ ” 

Well, I got a pretty good opimon,” said Harriet, feeling a hideous 
qualm of uncertainty, and cursing Professor Pliggins from the bottom 
of her heart “ But of course ” 

At this point, Miss Lydgate espied another old pupil in the distance 
and ran away Phoebe Tucker had already been lost on the way acioss 
the lawn Harnet was left to her fate After ten minutes, during wluch 
Miss de Vine ruthlessly turned her victim’s brain inside out, shook the 
facts out of It like a vigorous housemaid shaking dust from a carpet, beat 
it, refreshed it, rubbed up the surface of it, relaid it in a new position and 
tacked it into place with a firm hand, the Dean mercifully came up and 
burst into the conversation 

** Thank goodness^ the Vice-Chancellor’s taking himself off Now we 
can get nd of this filthy old bombazine and show off our party frocks 
Why did we ever clamour for degrees and the fun of stewing m full 
academicals on a hot day ^ There * he’s gone ^ Give me those anythmg- 
but-glad-rags and I’ll shove them into the SCR with mine Has yours 
got a name on it, Miss Vane ^ Oh, good girl ^ Fve got three unknown 
gowns sitting in my office already Found lying about at the end of term 
No clue to owneis, of course The untidy little beasts seem to think it’s 
our job to sort out their miserable belongings They strew them every- 
where, regardless, and then borrow each other’s , and if anybody’s fined 
80 



for being out without a gown, it’s always because somebody pinched it 
And the wretched things are always as dirty as dish-clouts They use 
them for dusters and drawing the fire up When I think how our devoted 
generation sweated to get the right to these garments — and these young 
things don’t care that for them ^ They go about looking all bits and 
pieces, like illustrations to Pendcnms — so out of date of them • But their 
idea of being modern is to imitate what male undergraduates were like 
half a century ago ” 

‘‘ Some of us old students aren’t much to write home about, said 
Harnet. “ Look at Gubbins, for instance ” 

Oh, my dear * That crashing bore And all held together with 
safety-pms And I wish she’d wash her neck ” 

“ I think,” said Miss de Vine, with painstaking readiness to set the 
facts in a just light, that the colour is natural to her skin ” 

“ Then she should eat carrots and clear her system,” retorted the 
Dean, snatching Harriet’s gown from her “ No, don’t you bother It 
won’t take me a minute to chuck them through the SCR window And 
don’t you dare to run away, or I shall pever find you again ” 

“ Is my hair tidy ^ ” inqiured Miss de Vine, becoming suddenly 
human and hesitating with the loss of her cap and gown 
“ Well,” said Harriet, surveying the thick, iron-grey coils from which 
a quantity of overwoiked hair-pms stood out like croquet-hoops, ** it’s 
coming down just a trifle ” 

“ It always does,” said Miss de Vine, making vague dabs at the pins 
** I think I shall have to cut it short It must be much less trouble that 
way ” 

“ I like It as it IS That big coil smts you Let me have a go at it, shall 

X ? 

I wish you would,” said the historian, thankfully submitting to 
having the pins thrust into place “ I am very stupid with my fingers I 
do possess a hat somewhere,” she added, with an irresolute glance round 
the quad, as though she expected to see the hat gi owing on a tree, ** but 
the Dean said we’d better stay here Oh, thank you That feels much 
better — a marvellous sense of secunty All ^ here’s Miss Martin Miss 
Vane has kindly been acting as faair-dresser to the White Queen — but 
oughtn’t I to put on a hat ^ ” 

** Not now,” said Miss Martin emphatically “ I’m going to have some 
proper tea, and so are you I’m ravenous I’ve been tagging after old 
Professor Boniface who’s mnety-seven and practically gaga, and scream- 
ing in his deaf car till I’m almost dead What’s the time ? W I’m like 
Marjory Fleming’s turkey — I do not give a single damn for the Old 
Students’ Meeting , I simply must eat and drink Let’s swoop down upon 
the table before Miss Shaw and Miss Stevens collar the last iccs ”

CHAPTER 11 


*Ti8 p’-oper to all melancholy men, saith Mercurmhs, whai 
conceit they have once entcrtainedf to be most intent, molent and 
continually about it Invitis occumt, do what they may, they cannot 
be nd of it, against their wills they must think of it a thousand 
times ovei, perpetuo molesiantur, nec oblivisct possmt, tliey are 
continually troubled with it, in company, out of company , at 
meat, at exercise, at all times and places, non desinunt ea, quae 
mtmme volunt, cogtiare , if it be offensive especially, they cannot 
forget It ROBERT BURTON 

So far, so good, thought Harnet, changing for dinner There had been 
baddish moments, like trying to renew contact with Mary Stokes 
There had also been a brief encounter with Miss Hillyard, the History 
tutor, who had never liked her, and who had said, with wry mouth and 
acidulated tongue, “ Well, Miss Vane, you have had some very varied 
expcnences since we saw you last ” But there had been good moments 
too, carrying with them the promise of permanence m a Heracleitean 
universe She felt it nught be possible to survive the Gaudy Dinner, 
though Mary Stokes had dutifully bagged for her a place next herself, 
which was trying Fortunately, she had contrived to get Phoebe Tucker 
on her other side (In these surroundings, she thought of them still as 
Stokes and Tucker ) 

The first thing to strike her, when the procession had slowly filed up 
to the High Table, and grace had been said, was the appalling noise m 
Hall “ Stake ” was the right word It fell upon one like the i ush and 
weight of a shouting waterfall , it beat on the ear like the hammer*^ 
clang of some infernal smithy , it savaged the air like the metallic clatter 
of fifty thousand monotype machines casting type Two hundred female 
tongues, released as though by a spring, burst into high, clamorous speech 
She had forgotten what it was like, but it came back to her to-nxght how, 
at the beginning of every term, she had felt that if the noise were to go 
on like that for one minute more, she would go quite mad Within a 
week, the effect of it had always worn ofiT Use had made her immune 
But now It shattered her unaccustomed nerves with all and more than 
all Its original violence People screamed in her car, and she found herself 
screaming back She looked rather anxiously at Mary ; could any 
invalid bear it ? Mary seemed not to notice , she was more animated 
than she had been earlier m the day and was screaming quite cheerfully 
at Dorothy CoHins. Harriet turned to Phoebe 
29 



“ Gosh ^ I’d forgotten what this row was like If I scream I shall be 
as hoarse as a crow Fm going to bellow at you in a fog-horn kind of 
voice Do you mind ^ ” 

“ Not a bit I can hear you quite well Why on earth did God give 
women such shrill voices ^ Though I don’t mine! frightfully It reminds 
me of native workmen quarrelling They’re doing us rather well, don’t 
you think ^ Much better soup than we ever got ” 

“ They’ve made a special effort for Gaudy Besides, the new Bursar’s 
rather good, I believe, she was something to do witli Domestic Economy 
Dear old Straddles had a mind above food ” 

Yes , but I liked Straddles She was awfully decent to me when I 
got ill just before Schools Do you remember ^ ” 

What happened to Straddles when she left ^ ” 

** Oh, she’s Treasurer at Bronte College Finance was really her line, 
you know She had a real genius for figures ” 

“ And what became of that woman — what’s her name ? — Peabody ? 
Freebody ? — ^you know — the one who alwavs said solemnly that her 
great ambition m life was to become Bursar of Shrewsbury ^ ” 

“ Oh, my dear ! She went absolutely potty on some new kind of 
religion and joined an extraordinary sect somewhere or other where 
they go about in loin-cloths and have agapemones of nuts and grape- 
fruit That is, if you mean Brodnbb ^ ” 

** Brodnbb — I knew it was something hke Peabody Fancy her of all 
people * So intensely practical and subfusc ” 

“ Reaction, I expect Repressed emotional instincts and all that She 
was frightfully sentimental inside, you know ” 

** I know She wormed round rather Had a sort of a G P for Miss 
Shaw Perhaps we were all rather inhibited in those days ” 

“ Well, the present generation doesn’t suffer from that. I’m told. JVb 
inhibitions of any kmd ” 

“ Oh, come, Phoebe We had a good bit of liberty Not like before 
Women’s Degrees We weren’t monastic ” 

“ No, but we were born long enough before the War to feel a few 
restrictions We inherited some sense of responsibility And Brodnbb 
came from a fearfully rigid sort of household — Positivists, or Unitarians 
or Presbyterians or something The present lot are the real war-time 
generation, you know ” 

So they are Well, I don’t know that I’ve any right to throw stones 
at Brodnbb ” 

“ Oh, my dear * That’s entirely different One thing’s natural , the 
Other’s — I don’t know, but it seems to me like complete degeneration 
of the grey matter She even wrote a book ” 

** About agapemones ^ ” 

Yes And the Higher Wisdom* And Beautiful Thought. That sort of 
thing. Full of bad syntax ” 

23 



“ Oh, lord ! Yes— that’s pretty awful, isn’t it ? I can’t think why fancy 
religions should have such a ghastly effect on one’s grammar.” 

“ It’s a kind of intellectual rot that sets in, Fni afraid. But which of 
them causes the other, or whether they’re both symptons of something 
else, I don’t know. What with Trimmer’s mental healing, and Henderson 
going nudist ” 

“ No ! ” 

“ Fact. There she is, at the next table. That’s why she’s so brown.” 

“ And her frock so badly cut. If you can’t be naked, be as ili-drcssed 
as possible, I suppose.” 

I sometimes wonder whether a little normal, hearty wickedness 
wouldn’t be good for a great many of us.” 

At this moment, Miss Mollison, from tliree places away on the same 
side of the table, leaned across her neighbours and screamed something. 

** What ? ” screamed Phoebe. 

Miss Mollison leaned still farther, compressing Dorothy Collins, Betty 
Armstrong and Mary Stokes almost to suffocation. 

** I hope Miss Vane isn’t telling you anything too blood-curdling ! ” 

** No,” said Harriet, loudly, “ Mrs. Bancroft is curdling my blood.” 

*‘How?” 

“ Telling me the life-histories of our year.” 

“ Oh 1 ” screamed Miss Mollison, disconcerted. The sei'vice of a dish 
of lamb and green peas intervened and broke up the formation, and her 
neighbours breathed again. But to Harriet’s intense horror, the question 
and reply seemed to have opened up an avenue for a dark, determined 
woman with large spectacles and rigidly groomed hair, who sat opposite 
to her, and who now bent over and said, in piercingly American accents : 

“ I don’t suppose you remember me, Miss Vane ? I was only in 
college for one term, but I would know you anywhere. I’m always 
recommending your books to my friends in America who are keen to 
study the British detective story, because I think they are just terribly 
good.” 

“ Very kind of you,” said Harriet, feebly. 

**And we have a very dear mutooal acquaintance,” went on the 
spectacled lady. 

Heavens I thought Harriet. What social nuisance is going to be dragged 
out of obscurity now ? And who is this frightful female ? 

“ Really ? ” she said, aloud, trying to gain time while she ransacked 
her memory. “ Who’s that, Miss ” 

“ Schuster-Slatt,” prompted Phoebe’s voice in her ear. 

Schuster-Slatt,” (Of course. Arrived in Harriet’s first summer term. 
Supposed to read Law, Left after one term because the conditions at 
Shrewsbury were too restrictive of liberty. Joined the Home Students, 
and passed mercifuUy out of one’s life.) 

How clever of you to know my name. Yes, well, you’ll be surprised 

a4 


when I teli you, but in my work I see so many of your British 
anstocracv 

Hell ^ thought Harriet Miss Schuster«Slatt’s strident tones 
dominated even the surrounding upioar 

“ Your marvellous Lord Peter He was so kind to me, and terribly 
interested when I told him I was at college with you I think he’s just a 
lovely man ” 

He has very nice manners,” said Harriet But the implication was 
too subtle Miss Schuster-Slatt proceeded 
“ He was just wonderful to me when I told him all about my work ” 
(I wonder what it is, thought Harriet ) “And of course I wanted to hear 
all about his thrilling detective cases, but he was much too modest to say 
anything Do tell me, Miss Vane, does he wear that cute little eyeglass 
because of his sight, or is it part of an old English tradition ^ ” 

“ I have never had the impertinence to ask him,” said Harriet 
“ Now isn’t that just like your Bntish reticence ^ ” exclaimed Miss 
Schuster-Slatt , when Mary Stokes struck in with 
“ Oh, Harriet, do tell us about Lord Peter * He must be perfectly 
charming, if he’s at all like his photograplis Of course you know him 
very well, don’t you ^ ” 

“ I worked with him over one case ” 

“ It must have been frightfully exciting Do tell us what he’s like ” 

“ Seeing,” said Harriet, m angry and desperate tones, “ seeing that 
he got me out of prison and probably saved me from being hanged, I 
am naturally bound to find him delightful ” 
cc I ji Mary Stokes, flushing scarlet, and shrinking from 
Harriet’s funous eyes as if she had received a blow ‘‘ I’m sorry — I didn’t 
think ” 

“ Well, there,” said Miss Schuster-Slatt, “ I’m afraid I’ve been very, 
very tactless My mother always said to me, ‘ Sadie, you’re the most 
tactless girl I ever had the bad luck to meet ’ But I am enthusiastic I 
get earned away I don’t stop to think I’m just the same with my work 
I don’t consider my own feelings , I don’t consider other people’s 
feelings I just wade right in and ask for what I want, and I mostly get 
It ” 

After which, Miss Schuster-Slatt, with more sensitive feeling than 
one might have credited her with, carried the conversation triumphantly 
away to the subject of her own work, which turned out to have some- 
thing to do with the sterilisation of the unfit, and the encouragement of 
matnmony among the intelligentsia 
Harriet, meanwhile, sat miserably wondering what devil possessed 
her to display every disagreeable trait in her character at the mere men- 
tion of Wimsey’s name He had done her no harm , he had only saved 
her from a shameful death and oflfered her an unswerving personal 
devotion , and for neither benefit had he ever claimed or expected her 

SS5 



gratitude It was not pretty that her only return should be a snarl of 
resentment. The fact is, thought Harriet, I have got a bad infenonty 
complex , unfortunately, the fact that I know it doesn*t help me to get 
nd of it I could have bkt d him so much it 1 could have met him on an 
equal footing 

The Warden rapped upon the table A welcome silence fell upon the 
Hall A speaker was rising to \ " pose the toast t f the Unnersity 

She spoke gravely, unrolling I’le great scroll of hi5tor>, pleading for 
the Humanities, proclaiming the Pax Aeaderruca to a world terrified 
With unrest “ Oxford has been called the home of lost causes if the love 
of learning for its own sake is a lost cause everywhere else m the world, 
let us see to it that heie at least, it finds its abiding home ” Magnificent, 
thought Harriet, but it is not war And then, her imagination weaving 
in and out of the spoken words, she saw it as a Holy War, and that whole 
wildly heterogeneous, that even slightiv absurd collection of chattering 
women fused into a corporate unity with one another and wath every 
man and woman to whom integnty of mmd meant more than matenal 
gain — defenders m the centrad keep of Man-soul, their personal differ- 
ences forgotten in face of a common foe To be true to one’s callmg, 
whatever follies one might commit in one’s emotional life, that was the 
way to spiritual peace How could one feel fettered, being the freeman 
of so great a city, or humiliated, where all enjoyed equal citizenship ^ 
The emment professor who rose to reply spoke of a diversity of gifts but 
the same spirit The note, once struck, vibrated on the bps of every 
speaker and the ear of every hearer Nor was the Warden’s review of the 
Academic year out of key with it appointments, degrees, fellowships — 
all these were the domestic details of the discipline without which the 
community could not function In the glamour of one Gaudy night, 
one could realise that one was a citizen of no mean city It might be an 
old and an old-fashioned city, with inconvenient buildings and narrow 
streets where the passers-by squabbled foolishly about the right of way ; 
but her foundations were set upon the holy hills and her spires touched 
heaven 

Leavmg the Hall in this rather exalted mood, Harriet found herself 
invited to take coffee with the Dean 

She accepted, after ascertaining that Mary Stokes was bound for bed 
by doctor’s orders and had therefore no claim upon her company She 
therefore made her way along to the New Qiiad and tapped upon Miss 
Martin’s door. Gathered together m the sittmg-room she found Betty 
Armstrong, Phoebe Tucker, Miss de Vine, Miss Stevens the Bursar, 
another of the Fellows who answered to the name of Barton, and a couple 
ofold students a few years semor to herself The Dean, who was dispens- 
ing coffee, hailed her arrival cheerfully. 

“ Come along ^ Here’s coffee that is coffee Can nothing be done about 
the Hall coffee, Steve ^ ** 

26 



“ Yes, if you’ll start a cofTee-fund,” replied the Bursar ** I don’t know 
if you’ve ever worked out the finance of really first-class coffee for two 
hundred people ” 

I know,” said the Dean “It’s so trying to be groveilmgly poor. 

I think I’d better mention it to Flackett You remember Flackett, the 
rich one, who was always rather odd She was in your year, Miss 
Fortescue She has been following me round, trying to present the 
College with a tankful of tropical fish Said she thought it would brighten 
the Science Lecture-Room ” 

“ If It would brighten some of the lectures,” said Miss Fortescue, it 
might be a good thing Miss Hillyard’s Constitutional Developments 
were a bit gruesome in our day ” 

** Oh, my dear * Those Constitutional Developments ’ Dear me, yes 
— they still go on She starts every year with about thirty students and 
ends up with two or three earnest black men, who take every word down 
solemnly in note-books Exactly the same lectures , I don’t think even 
fish would help them Anyway, I said, * It’s very good of you, Miss 
Flackett, but I really don’t think they’d thrive It would mean putting 
m a special heating system, wouldn’t it ^ And it would make extra work 
for the gardeners * She looked so disappomted, poor thing , so I said 
she’d better consult the Bursar ” 

** All right,” said Miss Stevens, “ I’ll tackle Flackett, and suggest the 
endowment of a coffee-fund ” 

“ Muck more useful than tropical fish,” agreed the Dean ** I’m afraid 
we do turn out some oddities And yet, you know, I believe Flackett is 
extremely sound upon the life-history of the liver-fluke Would anybody 
like a Benedictine with the coffee ^ Come along. Miss Vane Alcohol 
loosens the tongue, and we want to hear all about your latest mysteries ” 

Harriet obliged with a brief resume of the plot she was working on 

“ Forgive me, Miss Vane, for speaking frankly,” said Miss Barton, 
leaning earnestly forward, “ but after your own ternble expenence, I 
wonder that you care about writing that kind of book ” 

The Dean looked a little shocked 

“ Well,” said Harriet, “ for one thing, writers can’t pick and choose 
until they’ve made money If you’ve made your name for one kind of 
book and then switch over to another, your sales arc apt to go down, 
and that’s the brutal fact ” She paused “ I know what you’re thinking 
— that anybody with proper sensitive feehng would rather scrub floors 
for a living But I should scrub floors very badly, and I write detective 
stones rather well I don’t sec why proper feeling should prevent me from 
doing my proper job ” 

“ Quite nght,” said Miss de Vine 

“ But surely,” persisted Miss Barton, “ you must feel that terrible 
crimes and the sufferings of innocent suspects ought to be taken 
seriously, and not just made into an intellectual game ” 

a? 



** I do take them seriously in real life Everybody must But should 
>ou say that anybody who liad tragic experience of sex, for example, 
should never write an ailificial drawing-room comedv > ” 

“ But isn’t that different ^ ” said Miss Ba^-ton, fi owning “ Ihere is a 
lighter side to love , whereas theie’s no lightei side to murder 
** Perhaps not, in the sense of a comic side But there is a purely 
intellectual side <*0 the detection ” 

You did investigate a case in real life, didn’t >ou ^ How did you feel 
about that ^ ” 

“ It was \ery interesting ” 

“ And, in the light of what you knew, did you like the idea of sending 
a man to the dock and the gallows ^ ” 

** I don’t think it’s quite fair to ask Miss Vane that,” said the Dean 
“ Miss Barton,” she added, a little apologetically , to Harriet, is inter- 
ested in the sociological aspects of ciime, and very eager for the reform 
of the penal code ” 

“ I am,” said Miss Baiton “ Our attitude to the whole thing seems to 
me completely savage and brutal I ha've met so many muidcrers when 
visiting prisons , and most of them aic very harmless, stupid people, 
poor creatures, when they aren’t definitely pathological ” 

“ You might feel differently about it,” said Harriet, “ if you’d hap- 
pened to meet the victims They are often still stupider and more 
harmless than the murderers But they don’t make a public appearance 
Even the jury needn’t see the body unless they like But I saw the body 
in that Wiivercombe case — I found it , and it was beastlier than anything 
you can imagine ” 

** I’m quite sure you must be right about that,” said the Dean The 
description in the papers was more than enough for me ” 

And,” went on Harriet to Miss Barton, “ you don’t see the murderers 
actively engaged in murdering You see them when they’re caught and 
caged and looking pathetic But the Wiivercombe man was a cunning, 
avaricious brute, and quite ready to go on and do it again, if he hadn’t 
been stopped ” 

That’s an unanswerable argument for stopping them,” said Phoebe, 
whatever the law does with them afterwards ” 

** All the same,” said Miss Stevens, isn’t it a little cold-blooded to 
catch murderers as an mtellectuai exercise It’s all right for the police — 
It’s their duty ” 

“ In law,” said Harriet, “ it is every citizen’s obligation— though most 
people don’t know that ” 

“ And this man Wimsey,” said Miss Barton, who seems to make 
a hobby of it — does he look upon it as a duty or as an mtellectuai 
exercise ^ ” 

” I’m not sure,” said Harriet, “ but, you know, it was just as well for 
me that he did make a hobby of it. The police were wrong m my case — 



I don’t blame them, but they weie — so I’m glad it wasn’t left to 
them ” 

“ I call that a perfectly noble speech,” said the Dean “ If anyone 
had accused me of doing something I hadn’t done, I should be foaming 
at the mouth ” 

“ But It’s my job to weigh evidence,” said Harriet, ‘ and I can’t help 
seeing the strength of the police case It’s a matter of a + b, you know 
Only there happened to be an unknown factor ” 

“ Like that thing that keeps cropping up m the new kind of physics,” 
said the Dean “ Planck’s constant, or whatever they call it ” 

Surely,” said Miss de Vine, whatever comes of it, and whatever 
anybody feels about it, the important thing is to get at the facts ” 

“ Yes,” said Harriet , “ that’s the point I mean, the fact is that I 
didrCt do the murder, so that my feelings are quite irrelevant If I had 
done it, I should probably have thought myself thoroughly justified, and 
been deeply indignant about the way I was treated As it is, I still think 
that to inflict the agonies of poisoning on anybody is unpardonable The 
particular trouble I got let in for was as much sheer accident as failing 
off a roof ” 

I really ought to apologise for having brought the subject up at all,” 
said Miss Barton It’s very good of you to discuss it so frankly ” 

“ I don’t mind — now It would have been different just after it 
happened But that awful business down at Wilvercombe shed rather a 
new light on the matter — showed it up from the other side ” 

“ Tell me,” said the Dean, Lord Peter — what is he like ^ ” 

“ To look at, do you mean ^ or to work with ^ ” 

** Well, one knows more or less what he looks like Fair and Mayfair 
I meant, to talk to ” 

** Rather amusing He does a good deal of the talking himself, if it 
comes to that ” 

** A little merry and bright, when you’re feeling off-colour ^ ” 

“ I met him once at a dog-show,” put in Miss Armstrong unexpectedly 
He was giving a perfect imitation of the silly-ass-about-town ” 

“ Then he was either frightfully bored or detecting something,” said 
Harriet, laughing “ I know that frivolous mood, and it’s mostly 
camouflage — but one doesn’t always know for what ” 

“ There must be something behind it,” said Miss Barton, “ because 
he’s obviously very intelligent. But is it only intelligence, or is there any 
genuine feeling ” 

“ I shouldn’t,” said Harriet, gazing thoughtfully into her empty 
coffee-cup, accuse him of any lack of feeling I’ve seen him very much 
upset, for instance, over convicting a sympathetic crimmal But he is 
really rather reserved, in spite of that deceptive manner ” 

** Perhaps he’s shy,” suggested Phoebe Tucker, kindly “ People who 
talk a lot often are I think they are very much to be pitied ” 


29 



** Shy ? said Hamet ** Well, hardly Nervy, perhaps— that blessed 
word covers a lot But he doesn’t exactly seem to rail for pity ” 

“ Why should he ^ said Miss Barton " In a very pitiful world, I 
don’t see much need to pity a young man who has cvcrvthing he can 
possibly want ” 

“ He must be a rcmaikable person if he has that,” said Miss dc Vine, 
with a gravity that her eyes belied 

And he’s not so young as ail that,” said Harriet ** He’s forty-five ’* 
(This was Miss Barton’s age ) 

** I think It’s rather an impertinence to pi tv people,” said the Dean 
Hear, hear ’ ” said Harnet Nobody likes being pitied Most of us 
enjoy self-pity, but that’s another thing ” 

** Caustic,” said Miss de Vine, “ but painfullv true ” 

“ But what I should like to know,” pursued Miss Barton, refusing to be 
diverted, “ is whether this dilettante gentleman does anything, outside 
his hobbies of detecting ciimes and collecting books, and, I believe, 
playing cricket in his off-time ” 

Harriet, who had been congratulating herself upon the way m which 
she was keeping her temper, was seized with irritation 
“ I don’t know,” she said “ Does it matter ^ Why should he do any- 
thing else ^ Catching murderers isn’t a soft job, or a sheltered job It 
takes a lot of time and energy, and you may very easily get injured or 
killed I dare say he does it for fun, but at any rate, he does do it Scores 
of people must have as much reason to thank him as I have You can’t 
call that nothing ” 

“ I absolutely agree,” said the Dean ” I think one ought to be very 
grateful to people who do dirty jobs for nothing, whatever their reason is ” 
Miss Fortescue applauded this ” The drams m my week-end cottage 
got stopped up last Sunday, and a most helpful neighbour came and 
unstopped them He got quite filthy m tlie process and I apologised 
profusely, but he said I owed him no thanks, because he was inquisitive 
and liked drains He may not have been telling the truth, but even if he 
was, I certainly had nothing to grumble about ” 

“ Talking of drains,” said the Bursar — 

The conversation took a less personal and moie anecdotal turn (for 
there is no chance assembly of people who cannot make lively conversa- 
tion about drams), and after a little time, Miss Barton retired to bed 
The Dean breathed a sigh of relief 

” I hope you didn’t mind too much,” she said^ Miss Barton is the 
most ternbly downnght persqn, and she was determined to get all that 
off her chest She is a splendid person, but hasn’t very much seme of 
humour She can’t bear anythmg to be done except from the very 
loftiest motives ” 

Hamet apologised for having spoken so vehemently 
** I thought you took it all wonderfully well And your Lord Peter 
SO 



sounds a most interesting person But I don’t see why you should be 
forced to discuss him, poor man ” 

“ If you ask me/’ observed the Bursar, “ we discuss everything a great 
deal too much m this university We argue about this and that and why 
and wherefoie, instead of getting the thing done ” 

But oughtn’t we to ask what things we want done,” objected the 
Dean 

Harriet grinned at Betty Armstrong, hearing the familiar academic 
wrangle btgm Before ten minutes had passed, somebody had introduced 
the word “ values ” An hour later they were still at it Finally the 
Bursar was heaid to quote 

“ God made the integers , all else is the work of man ” 

“ Oh, bother ’ ” cried the Dean “ Do let’s keep mathematics out of 
it And physics I cannot cope with them ” 

“ Who mentioned Planck’s constant a little time ago ^ ” 

“ I did, and I’m sorry for it I call it a revolting little object ” 

The Dean’s emphatic tones reduced everybody to laughter, and, 
midnight striking, the party broke up 
“ I am still living out of College,” said Miss de Vine to Harriet “ May 
I w^alk acioss to your room with you ^ ” 

Harriet assented, wondenng what Miss de Vine had to say to her. 
They stepped out together into the New Quad The moon was up, 
painting the buildings with cold washes of black and silver whose 
austerity rebuked the yellow gleam of lighted wmdows behind which 
old friends reunited still made merry with talk and laughter 
It might almost be term-time,” said Harriet 
‘‘ Yes ” Miss de Vine smiled oddly ‘‘ If you were to listen at those 
windows, you would find it was the middle-aged ones who were making 
the noise The old have gone to bed, wondenng whether they have worn 
as badly as their contemporaries They have suffered some shocks, and 
their feet hurt them And the younger ones are chattenng soberly about 
life and its responsibilities But the women of forty are pretending they 
are undergraduates again, and finding it rather an effort Miss Vane — 
I admired you for speaking as you did to-mght. Detachment is a rare 
virtue, and very few people find it lovable, either in themselves or in 
others If you ever find a person who likes you m spite of it — still more, 
because of it — that liking has very great value, because it is perfectly 
smeere, and because, with that person, you will never need to be 
anything but sincere yourself ” 

That is probably very true,” said Harnct, “ but what makes you 
say It ^ ” 

** Not any desire to offend you, believe me But I imagme you come 
across a number of people who are disconcerted by the difference 
between what you do feel and what they fancy you ought to feel. It is 
fatal to pay the smallest attention to them ” 


31 



“ YeSs” i»aid Haniet, “ but I am one of them I d*sconcei t myself very 
much I never knoMr what I do ieei ** 

“ I don’t think that matters provided one doesn’t tiy to peisuade one’s 
seif xnto appropiiate feelings ” 

They had entered the Old Quad, and the ancient beeches, most 
venerable of ail Shrewsbur>^ institutions, cast o^er tnern a dappled and 
changing shadow-pattern that was more confusing than daikncss 
“But one has to make some sort of choice,”’ said Harnet “And 
between one desiie and anotiier, how is one to know which things are 
really of overmastering importance ^ ” 

“ We can only know that,” said Miss de Vine, “ when they have 
overmastered us ” 

The chequered shadow dropped off them, like the dropping of linked 
silver chains Each after each, fiom all the toueis of Oxfoid, clocks 
struck the quarter-chime, m a tumbling cascade of fnendiv disagreement 
Miss de Vine bade Harnet good night at the door of Burleigh Building 
and vanished, with her long, stooping stride beneath the Hall archway 


An odd woman, thought Harnet, and of a penetrating shrewdness 
All Harnct’s own tragedy had sprung from “ persuading herself into 
appropriate feelings ” towards a man whose own feelings had not stood 
up to the test of sincerity either And all her subsequent instability 
of purpose had sprung from the determination that never again would 
she mistake the will to feel for the feeling itself “ We can only know what 
things are of overmastering importance w^hen they have overmastered 
us ” Was there anything at all that had stood firm m the midst of her 
indecisions ? Well, yes , she had stuck to her work — and that in the face 
of what might have seemed overwhelming reasons for abandoning it and 
doing something different Indeed, though she had shown cause that 
evening for this particular loyalty, she had never felt it necessary to show 
cause to herself She had written what she felt herself called upon to 
write , and, though she was beginning to feel that she might perhaps do 
this thing better, she had no doubt tliat the thing itself was the right 
thing for her It had overmastered her without her knowledge or notice, 
and that was the proof of its mastery* 

She paced for some minutes to and fro in the quad, too restless to go 
in and sleep As she did so, her eye was caught by a sheet of paper, 
fluttering untidily across the tnm turf Mechanically she picked it up 
and, seeing that it was not blank, earned it into Burleigh Building with 
her for examination It was a sheet of common scribbling paper, and all 
It bore was a childish drawing scrawled heavily m pencil It was not in 
any way an agreeable drawmg— not at all the kind of thing that one 
would expect to find in a college quadrangle It was ugly and sadistic. 
It depicted a naked figure of exaggeratedly feminine outlines, indicting 

32 



savage and hiiniiixating outrage upon some person oi indeterminate 
gender clad m a cap and gown. It was neithei sane nor healthy , it was, 
in fact, a nasty, dirty and lunatic scribble 
Hairiet stared at it for a little time in disgust, while a number of 
questions formed themselves m her mind Then she took it upstairs with 
her into the nearest lavatoiy% dropped it in and pulled the plug on it 
That was the proper fate for such things, and there was an end of it , 
but for all that, she wished she had not seen it 


CHAPTER III 

They do best who, if they cannot but admit love, yet make it 
keep quarter, and sever it wholly from their serious affairs and 
actions of life , for if it check once witli business it troubleth 
men’s fortunes, and maketh men that they can no ways be true 
to their own ends Francis bacon 

Sunday, as the SCR always declared, was invaiiably the best part of 
a Gaudy The official dinner and speeches were got out of the way , the 
old students lesident m Oxford, and the immensely busy visitors with 
only one night to spare had all cleared off People began to sort them- 
selves out, and one could talk to one’s friends at leisure, without being 
instantly collared and hauled away by a collection of bores 
Harriet paid her visit of state to the Warden, who was holding a small 
reception with sherry and biscuits, and then went to call upon Miss 
Lydgate in the New Quad The English tutor’s room was festooned with 
proofs of her forthcoming work on the prosodic elements in English 
verse from Beowulf to Bridges Since Miss Lydgate had perfected, or was 
in process of peifecting (since no work of scholarship ever attains a 
static peifection) an entirely new piosodic theory, demanding a novel 
and complicated system of notation which involved the use of twelve 
different varieties of type , and since Miss Lydgate’s handwriting was 
difficult to read and her experience in dealing with pnnters limited, 
there existed at that moment five successive revises in galley form, at 
different stages of completion, together with two sheets in page-|>roof, 
and an appendix in typescript, while the important Introduction which 
afforded the key to the whole argument still remained to be written It 
was only when a section had advanced to page-proof condition that 
Miss Lydgate became fully convinced of the necessity of transferring 
laige paragraphs of argument from one chapter to another, each change 
of this kind naturally demanding expensive over-running on the page- 
proof, and the elmiination of the corresponding portions in the five 

G N --2 33 



sets of revises , so that m the course of the necessary cross-reference, 
Miss Lydgate would be discovered by her pupils and colleagues wound 
into a kind of paper cocoon and helplessly searching for hei fountain-pen 
amid the litter 

‘‘ I am afraid/’ said Miss Lydgate, rubbing hei head, m response to 
Harriet’s polite inquiries as to the magnum opus, I am dreadfully 
Ignorant about the practical side of book-making I find it very con- 
fusing and I’m not at all clever at explaining myself to the pnntei-s It 
will be a great help having Miss de Vine here She has such an orderly 
i|imd It’s really an education to see her manuscript, and of course her 
^ork IS far more intricate than mine — all soits of little items out of 
Elizabethan pay-rolls and so on, all wonderfully sorted out and arranged 
m a beautiful clear argument And she understands setting out footnotes 
properly, so that they fit in with the text I always find that so difficult, 
and though Miss Harper is kindly doing all my typing for me, she really 
knows more about Anglo-Saxon than about compositois I expect you 
remember Miss Harper She was two years junior to you and took a 
second m English and lives in the Woodstock Road ” 

Harriet said she thought footnotes were always very tiresome, and 
might she see some of the book 

” Weil, if you’re really interested,” said Miss Lydgate, ** but I don’t 
want to bore you ” She extracted a couple of paged sheets from a desk 
stuffed with papers “ Don’t prick your fingers on that bit of manuscript 
that’s pinned on I’m afraid it’s rather full of marginal balloons and 
interlineations, but you see, I suddenly realised that I could work out a 
big improvement m my notation, so I’ve had to alter it all through I 
expect,” she added wistfully, “ the prmtei'S will be rather angry with me/’ 
Haniet pnvately agreed with her, but said comfortingly that the 
Oxford University jc^ress was no doubt accustomed to deexphenng the 
manuscripts of scholars 

** I sometimes wonder whether I am a scholar at all,” said Miss Lyd- 
gate It’s all quite clear in my head, you know, but I get muddled 
when I put it down on paper How do you manage about your plots ^ 
All that time-table work with the alibis and so on must be terribly hard 
to bear m mind ” 

“ I’m always gettmg mixed up myself,” admitted Harriet ** Fve 
never yet succeeded m produemg a plot without at least six major 
howlers Fortunately, nme readers out of ten get mixed up too, so it 
doesn’t matter The tenth wntes me a letter, and I promise to make the 
correction m the second edition, but I never do After all," my books arc 
only meant for fun j it’s not like a work of scholarship ” 

*‘You always had a scholarly mind, though,” said Miss Lydgate, 
and I expect you find your traimng a help m some ways, don’t you ? 
used to tffink you might take up an academic career ” 

** Are you disappomtcd that I didn’t ^ ” 


34 



** No, indeed I think it’s so nice that oixr students go out and do such 
varied and interesting things, provided they do them well And I must 
say, most of oui students do do exceedingly good work along their own 
lines 

“ What are the present lot like ^ ” 

“ Well,” said Miss Lydgate, ** we’ve got some veiy good people up, 
and they work surprisingly hard, when you think of all the outside 
activities they manage to carry on at the same time Only sometimes I’m 
afraid they rather overdo it, and don’t get enough sleep at night What 
with young men and motor-cars and parties, their lives are so much 
fuller than they were before the War — even more so than in your day, 
I think I’m afraid our old Warden would be very greatly disconcert^ 
if she saw the college as it is to-day I must say that I am occasionally 
a little startled myself, and even the Dean, who is so broad-mmded, 
thinks a brassiere and a pair of drawers rather unsmtable for sun- 
bathing in the quad It isn’t so much the male undergraduates — they’re 
used to It — but after all, when the Heads of the men’s colleges come to 
call on the Warden, they really ought to be able to get through the 
grounds without blushing Miss Martin has really had to insist on 
bathing dresses — backless if they like, but proper ba thin g dresses made 
for the purpose, and-not ordinary underwear.” 

Harriet agreed that this seemed only reasonable 

** I am so glad you think so,” said Miss Lydgate It is rather difficult 
for us of the older generation to hold the balance between tradition and 
progress — if it is progress Authority as such commands very httle 
respect nowadays, and I expect that is a good thing on the whole, though 
It makes the work of running any kind of institution more difficult I am 
sure you would like a cup of coffee No, really — I always have one 
myself about this time Annie ’ — I think I hear my scout in the pantry — 
Annie * Would you please bring in a second cup for Miss Vane.” 

Harnet was fairly well satisfied already with eatables and drinkables, 
but politely accepted the refreshment brought in by the smartly uni- 
formed maid She made some remark, when the door was shut again, as 
to the great improvements made since her own day in the staff and 
service at Shrewsbury, and again heard the praise awarded to the new 
Bursar 

“ Though I am afraid,” added Miss Lydgate, “ we may have to lose 
Annie from this staircase Miss Hillyard finds her too independent , and 
perhaps she ts a httle absent-minded But then, poor thmg, she is a 
widow with two children, and really ought not to have to be in service 
at all Her husband was m quite a good position, I believe, but he went 
out of his mind, or something, poor man, and died or shot himself, or 
something tragic of that kind, leaving her very badly off, so she was 
glad to take what she could The little girls are boarded out with Mrs 
Jukes — ^you remember the Jukeses, they were at the St Gross Lodge in 

35 



your time. They live down in St Aidate^s noWj> so Annie is able to go 
and see them at week-ends It is nice for her and brings in a liiSe extra 
for Mrs Jukes ** 

** Did Jukes retire ^ He wasn’t very old, was he ^ ” 

Poor Jukes,” said Miss Lydgate, her kind face clouding He got 
into sad trouble and we were obliged to dismiss him He turned out to 
be not quite honest, I am soirv to say But we found him work as a 
jobbing gaidener,” she went on more cheei fully, ** where he wouldn t 
be exposed to so much temptation in the matter of paicels and so on He 
was a most hard-working man, but he would put money on horse-races, 
and so, naturally, he found himself m difficulties It was so unfortunate 
for his wife ” 

“ She was a good soul,” agreed Harnet 
She was terribly upset about it all,” w^ent on Miss Lydgate And 
so, to do him justice, was Jukes He quite bioke down, and there was a 
sad scene with the Buisar when she told him he must go ” 

“ Ye-es,” said Harriet “Jukes always had a pretty glib tongue ” 

“ Oh, but I’m sure he was really very sorry for what he’d done He 
explained how he’d slipped into it, and one thing led to another We 
were all very much distressed about it Except, perhaps, the Dean — but 
then she nevei did like Jukes very much How^ever, we made a small loan 
to his wife, to pay off his debts, and they certainly repaid it most honestly, 
a few shillings each week Now that he’s put straight I feel suie he will 
keep straight But, of course, it was impossible to keep him on here One 
could never feel absolutely easy, and one must have entire confidence in 
the porter The present man, Padgett, is most reliable and a very amus- 
ing character You must get the Dean to tell you some of Padgett’s 
qumnt sayings ” 

“ He looks a monument of integiity,” said Harriet “ Pie may be less 
popular, on that account Jukes took bribes, you know — if one came in 
late, and that sort of thing ” 

“We were afiaid he did,” said Miss Lydgate “ Of couise, it’s a 
responsible post for a man who isn’t of very strong character He’ll do 
much better where he is ” 

“ You’ve lost Agnes, too, I see ” 

“ Yes — ^she was Head-Scout in your time , yes, she has left She began 
to find the work too much for her and had to retire I’m glad to say we 
were able to squeeze out a tmy pension for her — only a trifle, but as you 
know, our income has to be stretched very carefully to cover everything 
And we arranged a little scheme by which she takes in odd jobs of 
mending and so on for the students and attends to the College linen It 
all helps , and she’s especially glad because that cnppled sister of hers 
can do part of the work and contribute something to their small income 
Agnes says the poor soul is so much happier now that she need not feel 
herself a burden ” 



Harriet marvelled^ not for the first time, at the untiring conscientious- 
ness of administrative women Nobody’s interests ever seemed to be 
oveiiooked or forgotten, and an endless goodwill made up for a perennial 
scarcity of funds 

Mter a Lttle more talk about the doings of past dons and students, 
the conversation turned upon the new Library The books had long 
outgiown their old home in Tudor Building, and were at last to be 
adequately housed 

“ And when that is fimshed,” said Miss Lydgate, “ we shall feel that 
our College Bulldi.ng^ are substantially complete It does seem rather 
wonderful to those of us who remember the early days when we only 
had the one funny old house with ten students, and were chaperoned 
to lectures in a donkey-carnage I must say we rather wept to see the 
dear old place pulled down to make way for the Library It held so 
many memories ” 

“ Yes, indeed,” said Harriet, sympathetically She supposed that there 
was no moment of the past upon which this expeiienced and yet innocent 
soul could not dv^eU with unaffected pleasure The entrance of another 
old pupil cut short her interview with Miss Lydgate, and she w^ent out, 
vaguely envious, to encounter the persistent Miss Mollison, piimed with 
every remorseless detail of the clock incident It gave her pleasure to 
inform Miss Mollison that Mi A E W Mason had bit on the same idea 
earlier Unquenchable, Miss Mollison proceeded to question hei victim 
eageily about Loid Peter Wimsey, his manners, customs and appear- 
ance , and when Miss Mollison was driven away by Miss Schuster 
Slatt, the irritation was little relieved, for Plarnel was subjected to a 
long harangue about the sterilisation of the unfit, to which (it appeared) 
a campaign to encourage the marriage of the fit was a necessary 
corollary Harriet agreed that intellectual women should many and 
reproduce their kind , but she pointed out that the English husband had 
something to say m the matter and that, very often, he did not care for 
an intellectual wife 

Miss Schustei-Slatt said she thought English husbands weie lovely, 
and that she was prepaiing a questionnaire to be circulated to the young 
men of the United Kingdom, with a view to finding out their 
matumomal preferences 

“ But English people won’t fill up questionnaires,” said Harriet 

“ Won’t fill up questionnaires ^ ” cned Miss Schuster-Slatt, taken 
aback 

“ No,” said Harriet, “ they won’t As a nation we are not questioiinaire- 
consaous ” 

“ Weil, that’s too bad,” said Miss Schuster-Slatt But I do hope you 
will ]oin the Biitish Branch of our League for the Encouragement of 
Matrimonial Fitness Our President, Mrs J Poppelhinken, is a wonder- 
ful woman You would so much like to meet her She will be coming to 

37 



Europe next year In tiic meantime I am here to do propas^anda and 
study the whole question fiom the angle of Biitish mentaiitv 

“ I’m afiaid >ou will find it a ver> difficult job I wonder,” added 
Harriet (for slit felt she owed Miss Schuster-SUtt a riposte for her unfor- 
tunate observations of the night before), “ whether youi intentions are 
as disinterested as you make out Periiaps you are thinking of investigat- 
ing the loveliness of English husbands in a personal and practical way ” 

“ Now you’re making fun of me,” said Miss Sehuster-Siatt, with 
perfect good-humour “ No I’m just the little worker-bee, gathering 
honey for the queens to eat ” 

“How all occasions do inform against me * ” muttered Hariiet to 
herself One would have thought that Oxford at least would offer a 
respite from Peter Wimsey and the mairiage question But although she 
herself was a notoriety, if not precisely a celebrity, it was an annoying 
fact that Peter was a still more spectacular celebrity, and that, of the 
two, people would rather know about him than about her As regards 
marriage — ^well, here one certainly had a chance to find out whether it 
worked or not Was it worse to be a Maiy Attwood {nk Stokes) or a 
Miss Schuster-Siatt ^ Was it better to be a Phoebe Bancroft {nk Tucker) 
or a Miss Lydgate ^ And would all these people have turned out exactly 
the same, marned or single ^ 

She wandered into the J G R which was empty, but for one drab 
and lil-dresscd woman who sat desolately reading an illustrated paper 
As Hamet passed, this woman looked up and said, rather tentatively, 
“ Hullo » It’s Miss Vane, isn’t it ? ” 

Hamet racked h^r memory hastily This was obviously someone very 
much senior to herself— she looked nearex fifty than forty Who on 
earth ? 

I don’t suppose you remember me,” said the other “ Catlienne 
Freemantle ” 

(Catherine Freemantle, good God ! But she had been only two years 
senior to Harriet Very brilliant, very smart, very lively and the out- 
standing scholar of her year What m Heaven’s name had happened to 
her 

“ Of course I remember you,” said Harriet, “ but I’m always so 
stupid about names. What have you been domg ^ ” 

Catherine Freemantle, it seemed, had mamed a farmer, and every- 
thing had gone wrong Slumps and sickness and tithe and taxes and the 
Milk Board and the Marketing Board, and worbng one’s fingers to the 
bone for a bare living and trying to bnng up children— Hamet had read 
and heard enough about agncultural depression to know that the story 
was a common one enough She was ashamed of being and looking so 
prosperous She felt she would rather be toed for life over again than 
walk the daily treadmill of Catherme’s life. It was a saga, in its way, but 
38 



it was preposterous She broke m rather abruptly upon a complaint 
against the hard-heartedness of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners 
** But Miss Freemantle — I mean, Mrs — ^Mrs Bendick — it’s absuid 
that you should have to do this kind of thmg I mean, pick your own 
fruit and get up at all hours to feed poultry and slave like a navvy. 
Surely to goodness it would have paid far better for you to take on some 
bnd of writing or intellectual job and get someone else to do the manual 
work ” 

Yes, it would But at the beginning I didn’t see it like that I came 
down with a lot of ideas about the dignity ot labour And besides, at that 
time, my husband wouldn’t ha\e liked it much if Fd separated myself 
from his interests Of course, we didn’t think it would turn out like this ’* 
What damned waste ^ was all Harriet could say to herself All that 
biilliance, all tliat trained intelligence, harnessed to a load that any un- 
educated country girl could have drawn, and drawn far better The thing 
had its compensations, she supposed She asked the question bluntly 
Worth It ^ said Mis Bendick Oh, yes, it was certainly worth it The 
job was worth doing One was serving the land And that, she managed 
to convey, was a service harsh and austere indeed, but a finer thing than 
spinnmg words on paper 

“ Fm quite prepared to admit that,” said Harriet “ A ploughshare is 
a nobler object than a razor But if your natural talent is for barbering, 
wouldn’t it be better to be a barber, and a good barber — and use the 
profits (if you like) to speed the plough ^ However grand the job may 
be, is It job ^ ” 

** It’s got to be my job now,” said Mrs Bendick “ One can’t go back 
to things One gets out of touch and one’s brain gets rusty If you’d 
spent your time washing and cooking for a family and digging potatoes 
and feeding cattle, you’d know that that kind of thing takes the edge off 
the razor You needn’t tnmk I don’t envy you people your easy life , I 
do I came to tlie Gaudy out of sentiment, and I wish Fd stopped away 
I’m two years older than you, but I look twenty None of you cares m 
the least for my interests, and yours ail seem to me to be meie beating 
the air. You don’t seem to have anything to do with real life You are 
going about in a dream ” She slopped speaking, and her angry voice 
softened ** But it’s a beautiful dream in its way It seems queer to me now 
to think that once I was a scholar I don’t know You may be right 
after ail Learning and literature have a way of outlasting the civilisation 
that made them ” 

** The word and nought else 
in time endures 
Not you long after, 
perished and mute 
will last, but the defter 
viol and lute,”

quoted Harriet She stared vaguely out into the sunshine It’s cuuous 
— because I have been thinking exactly the same thing — only in a 
different connection Look here ^ I admiie >ou like hell, but I believe 
you’re all wrong I’m sure one should do one’s own job, however trivial, 
and not persuade one’s sell into doing somebody elsc’s, however noble ” 

As she spoke, she remembered Miss de Vine , here was a new aspect 
of persuasion 

** That’s all very well,” replied Mis BendicL ‘‘ But one’s rather apt 
to marry into somebody else’s job ” 

True , but Harriet was offeied the opportunity of many mg into a job 
as near her own as made no gieat difference And into money enough to 
make any job supereiogatory Again she saw herself unfaiil> provided 
with advantages which more deserving people desired in vam 

I suppose,” she said, “ mariiage is the really important job, isn’t 

It?” 

Yes, it IS,” said Mrs Bendick “ My marriage is happy as marriages 
go But I often wonder whether my husband wouldn’t have been 
better off with another Lind of wife He never says so, but I wonder I 
think he knows I miss — things, and resents it sometimes I don’t know 
why I should say this to you — I’ve never said it to anybody and I never 
knew you very well, did I ^ ” 

** No , and I haven’t been very sympathetic, either In fact, I’ve been 
disgustingly rude ” 

“ You have, rather,” said Mrs Bendick But you have such a 
beautiful voice to be rude in ” 

“ Good gracious • ” said Harriet 

“ Our farm’s on the Welsh border, and the people all speak m the 
most hideous local sing-song Do you know wdiat makes me feel most 
home-sick here^ The cultured speech The dear old much-abused 
Oxford accent That’s funny, isn’t it ^ ” 

“ I thought the noise in Hall was more like a cage full of peacocks ” 
Yes , but out of Hall you can pick out the people w]io speak the 
right way Lots of them don’t, of course, but some do You do , and 
you have a lovely voice into the bargain Do you remember the old 
Bach Choir days ^ ” 

“ Do I not ^ Do you manage to get anv music on the Welsh bordei ^ 
The Welsh can sing ” 

“ I haven’t much time for music I try to teach the children ” 

Harriet took advantage of this opening to make suitable domestic 
inquiries She parted eventually from Mrs Bendick with a depressed 
feehng that she had seen a Derby winner making shift with a coal-cart 

Sunday lunch in Hall was a casual affair Many people did not attend 
It, having engagements in the town Those who did, dropped m as and 
when they liked, fetched their food from the serving-hatches and 
40 



consumed it in chattering groups wherever they could find seats 
Harnctj having seized a plate of cold ham for herself, looked round for 
a lunch partner, and was thankful to see Phoebe Tucker just come in 
and being helped by the attendant scout to a portion of cold roast beef 
The two joined forces, and sat down at the far end of a long table which 
ran parallel to the High and at right angles to the other tables From 
mere they commanded the whole room, including the High Table 
Itself and the row of serving-hatches As her eye wandered from one 
bnsklv occupied luncher to the next, Harriet kept on asking herself. 
Which ^ Which of all these normal and cheerful-looking women had 
dropped that unpleasant paper in the quad the night before Because 
you never knew , and the trouble of not knowing was that you dimly 
suspected everybody Haunts ot ancient peace were all very well, but 
very odd things could crawl and creep beneath lichen-covered stones 
The Warden in her gieat caived chair was bending her stately head and 
snuling at some jest of the Dean’s Miss Lydgate was attending, with 
eager courtesy, to the wants of a very old student indeed, who was 
almost blind She had helped her stumblmg feet up the three steps of 
the dais, had fetched her lunch from the hatch and was now putting 
salad on her plate for her Miss Stevens, the Bursar, and Miss Shaw, the 
Modern Language Tutor, had collected about them three other old 
students of considerable age and attainments , their conversation was 
animated and apparently amusing Miss Pyke, the Classical Tutor, was 
deep in a discussion with a tall, robust woman whom Phoebe Tucker had 
recognised and pointed out to Harriet as an eminent archseologist, and 
in a momentary flash of comparative silence, the Tutor’s high voice rang 
out unexpectedly “ The tumulus at Halos appears to be an isolated 
instance The cist-graves of Theotokou ” Then the clamour again 
closed over the argument Two other dons, whom Harriet did not recog- 
nise (they were new since her day) appeared from their gestures to be 
discussing millinery Miss Hillyaid, whose sarcastic tongue tended to 
isolate her from her colleagues was slowly eating her lunch and glancing 
at a pamphlet she had brought in with her Miss de Vine, arriving late, 
sat down beside Miss Hillyard and began to consume ham m a detached 
way with her eyes fixed on vacancy 
Then the Old Students in the body of the Hall — all types, all ages, all 
varieties of costume Was it the curious round-shouldered woman in a 
yellow djibbah and sandals, with her hair coiled in two snail-shells 
over her ears ^ Or the sturdy, curly-headed person in tweeds, with 
a masculine-lookmg waistcoat and the face like the back of a cab ^ 
Or the tightly-corseted pei oxide of sixty, whose hat would better have 
suited an eighteen-year-old debutante at Ascot ^ Or one of the innumer- 
able women with school-teacher ” stamped on their resolutely cheery 
countenances ^ Or the plain person of indeterminate age who sat at the 
head of her table with the air of a chairman of committee ^ Or that 
2 * 4 * 



curious little creature dressed in unbecoming pink, who looked as though 
she had been carelessly packed away in a drawer all winter and put 
into circulation again without being ironed ^ Or that handsome, well- 
preserved business woman of fifty with the well-manicured hands, who 
broke into the conversation of total strangers to inform them that she had 
just opened a new hairdressing establishment “just off Bond Street ” ^ 
Or that tall, haggard, tragedy-queen in black silk marocain who looked 
like Hamlet’s aunt, but was actually Aunt Beatrice who ran the House- 
hold Column in the Daily Mercury ? Or the bony woman with the 
long horse-face who had devoted herself to Settlement work ^ Or even 
that unconquerably merry and bright little dumpling of a creature who 
was the highly-valued secretary of a political secretary and had secre- 
taries under her ^ The faces came and went, as though m a dream, all 
ammated, all inscrutable 

Relegated to a remote table at the lower end of the Hall were half-a- 
dozen present students, still Imgenng in Oxford for viva voce examina- 
tions They babbled continually among themselves, rather obviously 
ignoring the invasion of their college by ail these quaint old freaks who 
were what they themselves would be m ten years’ time, or twenty or 
thirty They were a badly-turned-out bunch, Harriet thought, with an 
end-of-term crumpled appearance There was an odd, shy-faced, sandy 
girl with pale eyes and restless fingers, and next to her a dark, beautiful 
one, for whose face men imght have sacked cities, if it had had any sort 
of animation , and there was a gawky and unfinished-looking young 
person, very badly made up, who had a pathetic air of seeking to win 
hearts and never succeeding , and, most interesting of the bunch, a girl 
with a face like eager flame who was dressed with a maddemng perversity 
of wrongness, but who one day would undoubtedly hold the world m her 
hands for good or evil The rest were nondescript, as yet undifferentiated 
— ^yet nondescripts, thought Harriet, were the most difficult of all human 
beings to analyse You scarcely knew they were there, until — bang * 
Something quite unexpected blew up like a depth charge and left you 
marvelhng, to collect strange floating debris 

So the Hall seethed, and the scouts looked on impassively from the 
serving-hatches “And what they think of us all, God only knows,” 
mused Harriet 

“ Are you plotting an exceptionally mtncate murder ^ ” demanded 
Phoebe’s voice in her ear. “ Or working out a difficult alibi ^ I’ve asked 
you three times to pass the cruet ” 

“ I’m sorry,” said Harriet, doing as she was requested “ I was 
meditatmg on the impenetrabihty of the human countenance ” She 
hesitated, on the verge of telhng Phoebe about the disagreeable drawing, 
but her fnend went on to ask some other question, and the moment 
passed by 

But the episode had troubled and unsettled her Passing through the 

4a 



empty Hall, later m the day, she stopped to stare at the portrait of that 
Mary, Countess of Shrewsbury, m whose honour the college had been 
founded The painting was a well-executed modern copy of the one m 
St John’s College, Cambridge, and the queer, stiong-featured face, 
with Its ill-tempered mouth and sidelong, secretive glance, had always 
exercised a curious fascination over her — even in her student days, a 
period when the portraits of dead and gone celebrities exposed in public 
places incur more sarcastic comment than reverential consideration. 
She did not know, and indeed had never troubled to inquire, how 
Shrewsbury College had come to adopt so ominous a patroness. Bess 
of Hardwick’s daughter had been a great intellectual, indeed, but 
something of a holy terror , uncontrollable by her menfolk, undaunted 
by the Tower, contemptuously silent before the Privy Council, an 
obstinate recusant, a staunch fiiend and implacable enemy and a lady 
with a turn for invective remarkable even in an age when few mouths 
suffered from mealiness She seemed, in fact, to be the epitome of every 
alanmng quality which a learned woman is popularly credited with 
developing Her husband, the “ great and glorious Earl of Shrewsbury,” 
had purchased domestic peace at a price , for, said Bacon, there was a 
greater than he, which is my Lady of Shrewsbury ” And that, of course, 
was a dreadful thing to have said about one The prospect seemed dis- 
couraging for Miss Schuster-Slatt’s matnmomal campaign, since the 
rule seemed to be that a great woman must either die unwed, to Miss 
Schuster-Slatt’s distress, or find a stiU greater man to marry her. And 
that liimted the great woman’s choice considerably, since, though the 
world of course abounded m great men, it contained a very much larger 
number of middling and common-place men The great man, on the 
other hand, could marry where he liked, not being restricted to great 
women , indeed, it was often found sweet and commendable in him to 
choose a woman of no sort of greatness at all 

Though of course,” Harriet reminded herself, ** a woman may 
achieve greatness, or at any rate great renown, by merely being a won- 
derful wife and mother, like the mother of the Gracchi ; whereas the 
men who have achieved great renown by being devoted husbands and 
fathers might be counted on the fingers of one hand Charles I was an 
unfortunate king, but an adimrable family man Still, you would 
scarcely class him as one of the world’s great fathers, and his children 
were not an unqualified success Dear me * Being a great father is either 
a very difficult or a very sadly unrewarded profession Wherever you 
find a great man, you will find a great mother or a great wife standing 
behmd him — or so they used to say It would be interestmg to know how 
many great women have had great fathers and husbands behind them. 
An interesting thesis for research Elizabeth Barrett ^ Well, she had a 
great husband, but he was great in his own right, so to speak — ^and Mr. 

Barrett was not exactly The Brontes ^ Well, hardly Queen Ehza- 

43 



beth ^ She had a remarkable father, but devoted helpfulness towards his 
daughters was scarcely his leading charactenstic And she was so wrong- 
headed as to have no husband Qjieen Victoria ^ You might make a 
good deal out of poor Albert, but you couldn’t do much with the Duke 
of Kent ” 

Somebody passed through the Hall behind her , it was Miss Hillyard 
With a mischievous deteimination to get some response out of this 
antagonistic personality, Harriet laid before her the new idea foi a 
historical thesis 

“ You have forgotten physical achievements,” said Miss Hillyard 
I believe many female singers, dancers, Channel swimmers and tennis 
stars owe everything to their devoted fathers ” 

“ But the fathers are not famous ” 

** No Self-effacing men are not popular with either sex I doubt 
whether even your literary skill would gam recognition for their virtues 
Particularly if you select your women for then intellectual qualities 
It will be a shoit thesis in that case ” 

“ Gravelled for lack of matter ? ” 

** I’m afraid so Do you know any man who sincerely admires a woman 
for her brains ^ ” 

“ Well,” said Harriet, “ certainly not many ” 

” You may think you know said Miss Hillyard, with a bitter 
emphasis “ Most of us think at some time or other that we know one 
But the man usually has some other little axe to grind ” 

“ Very likely,” said Haniet You don’t seem to have a very high 
opinion of men — of the male character, I mean, as such ” 

“ No,” said Miss Hillyard, not very high But they have an admirable 
talent for imposing their point of view on society in general All women 
are sensitive to male criticism Men are not sensitive to female criticism 
They despise the critics ” 

“ Do you, personally, despise male criticism ^ ” 

” Heartily,” said Miss Hillyard ” But it does damage Look at this 
Umversity All the men have been amazingly kind and sympathetic 
about the Women’s Colleges Certainly But you won’t find them 
appointing women to big Umversity posts That would never do The 
women might perform their work in a way beyond criticism But they 
are quite pleased to see us playing with our little toys ” 

Excellent fathers and family men,” murmured Harriet 
“ In that sense — ^yes,” said Miss Hillyard, and laughed rather 
unpleasantly 

Something funny here, thought Harriet A personal history, probably 
How difficult It was not to be embittered by personal experience. She 
went down to the J G R and examined herself in the mirror There had 
been a look in the History Tutor’s eyes that she did not wish to discover 
m her own. 

44 



Sunday evening prayers The College was undenominational, but 
some form of Christian worship was held to be essential to community 
life The chapel, with its stained glass windows, plain oak panelhng 
and unadorned Communion Table was a kind of Lowest Common 
Multiple of all sects and creeds Harriet, making her way towards it, 
remembered that she had not seen her gown since the previous afternoon, 
when the Dean had taken it to the SCR Not liking to penetrate 
umnvited into that Holy of Holies, she went in search of Miss Martin, 
who had, it appeared, taken both gowns together to her own room. 
Hariiet wriggled into the gown, one fluttermg sleeve of which struck an 
adjacent table with a loud bang 
“ Mercy ’ ” said the Dean, what’s that ^ ” 

” My cigarette-case,” said Harriet I thought I’d lost it I remember 
now I hadn’t a pocket yesterday, so I shoved it into the sleeve of my 
gown After all, that’s what these sleeves are for, aren’t they ^ ” 

Oh, my dear » Mine are always a perfect dirty-ciothes bag by the 
end of term When I have absolutely no clean handkerchiefs left in the 
drawer, my scout turns out my gown sleeves My best collection worked 
out at twenty-two — ^but then I’d had a bad cold one week Dreadful 
insamtary garments Here’s your cap Never mind taking your hood — 
you can come back here for it What have you been doing to-day ^ — 
I’ve scarcely seen you ” , 

Again Harriet felt an impulse to mention the unpleasant drawing, but 
again she refrained She felt she was getting rather unbalanced about 
It Why think about it at all ^ She mentioned her conversation with 
Miss Hillyard 

** Lor’ ’ ” said the Dean ** Thai’s Miss Hillvard’s hobby-horse 
Rubbidge, as Mrs Gamp would say Of course men don’t like having 
their poor little noses put out of joint — ^whodoes ^ I think it’s perfectly 
noble of them to let us come trampling over their University at all, 
bless their hearts They’ve been used to being loids and masters for 
hundreds of years and they want a bit of time to get used to the change 
Why, It takes a man months and months to reconcile himself to a new hat. 
And jtist when you’re preparing to send it to the jumble sale, he says, 

‘ That’s rather a nice hat you’ve got on, where did you get it ^ ’ And you 
say, ‘ My dear Hemry, it’s the one I had last year and you said made me 
look like an organ-grinder’s monkey ’ My brother-in-law says that 
every time, and it does make my sister so wild ” 

They mounted the steps of the chapel 


It had not, after all, been so bad Definitely not so bad as one had 
expected Though it was melancholy to find that one had grown out of 
Mary Stokes, and a little tiresome, in a way, that Mary Stokes refused to 
recognise the fact Harriet had long ago discovered that one could not 

45 



like people any the better, merely because they were ill, or dead — ^still 
less because one had once liked tiiem very much Some happy souls 
could go through life witiiout making this discovery, and they were the 
men and women who were called “ sincere Still, there remained old 
friends whom one was glad to meet again, like the Dean and Phcebe 
Tucker And really, everybody had been quite extraordinarily decent 
Rather inqmsitive and silly about “ the man Wimsey,” some of them, 
but no doubt with the best intentions Miss Hiilyard might be an 
exception, but there had always been something a little twisted and 
uncomfortable about Miss Hiilyard 

As the car wound its way over die Chilterns, Harriet grinned to 
heiself, thinking of her parting conversation with the Dean and Bursar 

“ Be sure and wTite us a new book soon And remember, if ever we 
get a mystery at Shrewsbury we shall call upon you to come and 
disentangle it 

“ All right,” said Harriet “ When you find a mangled corpse in the 
buttery, send me a wire — and be sure you let Miss Barton view the body, 
and then she won’t so much mind my haling the murderess off to 
justice ” 

And suppose they actually did find a bloody corpse in the buttery, how 
surprised they would all be The glory of a college was that nothing 
drastic ever happened in it The most frightful thing that was ever likely 
to happen was that an undergraduate should “ take the wrong turning 
The purloining of a parcel or two by a porter had been enough to throw 
the whole Senior Common Room mto consternation Bless their hearts, 
how refreshing and soothing and good they all were, walbng beneath 
their ancient beeches and meditating on ov Kal (X'q vo and the finance 
of Qiieen Elizabeth 

** I’ve broken the ice,” she said aloud, “ and the water wasn’t so cold 
after all I shall go back, from time to time 1 shall go back ” 

She picked out a pleasant pub for Itmch and ate with a good appetite 
Then she remembered that her cigarette-case was still in her gown She 
had brought the garment m with her on her arm, and, thi listing her 
hand down to the bottom of the long sleeve, she extracted the case A 
piece of paper came out with it — an ordinary sheet of scribbling paper 
folded into four She frowned at a disagreeable memory as she unfolded 
It 

There was a message pasted across it, made up of letters cut apparently 
from the headlmes of a newspaper 

YOU DIRTY MURDERESS AREN’T YOU 
ASHAMED TO SHOW YOUR FACE ^ 

** Hell I ” said Hamet, “ Oxford, thou too ^ ” She sat very still for a 
few moments Then she struck a match and set light to the paper It 

46 



burned briskly, till she was forced to drop it upon her plate, Even then 
the letters showed grey upon the crackling blackness, until she pounded 
their spectral shapes to powder with the back of a spoon

WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE 

There are incidents in one’s life which, through some haphazard 
coincidence of time and mood, acquire a symbolic value. Harriet’s 
attendance at the Shrewsbury Gaudy was of this kind In spite of minor 
incongruities and absurdities, it had shown itself to have one definite 
significance , it had opened up to her the vision of an old desire, long 
obscured by a forest of irrelevant fancies, but now standing up unmis- 
takable, like a tower set on a hill Two phrases rang m her ears • the 
Dean’s, “It’s the work you’re doing that really counts”, and that 
one melancholy lament for eternal loss “ Once, I was a scholar ” 

“ Time IS,” quoth the Brazen Head , “ time was , time is past ” 
Philip Boyes was dead , and the nightmares that had haunted the 
ghastly midnight of his passing were gradually fading away, Qingmgon, 
by blind instinct, to the job that had to be done, she had fought her way 
back to an insecure stability Was it too late to achieve wholly the clear 
eye and the untroubled mmd ^ And what, m that case, was she to do 
with one powerful letter which still tied her ineluctably to the bitter 
past ^ What about Peter Wimsey 

During the past three years, their relations had been peculiar Immedi- 
ately after the horrible business that they had investigated together at 
Wilvercombe, Harriet — feeling that something must be done to ease a 
situation which was fast becoming intolerable — had carried out a long- 
cherished scheme, now^ at last made practicable by her increasing 
reputation and income as a wnter Taking a woman fnend with her as 
compamon and secretary, she had left England, and travelled slowly 
about Europe, staying now here, now there, as fancy dictated or a good

background presented itself for a story Financially the trip had been a 
success Sne had gathered material for two full-length novels, the scenes 
laid respectively in Madiid and Carcassonne, and written a series of 
short stones dealing with detective adventures in Hitlerite Berlin, and 
also a number of travel articles , thus more than replenishing the 
treasury Before her departure, she had asked Wimsey not to write He 
had taken the prohibition with unexpected meekness 

** I see Very well Vade ip pacem If you ever want me, vou will find the 
Old Firm at the usual stand 

She had occasionally seen his name in the English papers, and that 
was all At the beginning of the following June, she had returned home, 
feeling that, aftei so long a break, there should be little difficulty in 
bringing the relationship to a cool and friendly close By this time he was 
probably feeLng as much settled and relieved as she was As soon as she 
got back to London, she moved to a new fiat in Mecklenburg Square, 
and settled down to work at the Carcassonne novel 
A tnfling incident, soon after her return, gave her the opportunity to 
test her own leactions She went down to Ascot, in company with a witty 
young woman writer and her barrister husband — partly for fun and 
partly because she wanted to get local colour for a short story, in which 
an unhappy victim was due to fall suddenly dead in the Royal Enclosure, 
just at the exciting moment wffien all eyes were glued upon the fimsh of 
a race Scanmng tliose sacred precincts, therefore, from without the pale, 
Harriet became aware that the local colour included a pair of slim 
shoulders tailored to swoomng-point and carrying a well-known parrot 
profile, thrown into prominence by the acute backward slant of a pale- 
grey topper A froth of summer hats billowed about this apparition, so 
that It resembled a slightly grotesque but expensive orchid m a bouquet 
of roses From the expressions of the parties, Harriet gathered that the 
summer hats were picking long-priced and impossible outsiders, and that 
the topper was receiving their instructions with an amusement amounting 
to hilarity At any rate, his attention was well occupied 

Excellent,” thought Harriet , ‘‘ nothing to trouble about there ” 
She came home rejoicing m the exceptional tranquillity of her own 
spirits Three days later, while reading in the morning paper that among 
the guests at a literary luncheon-paity had been seen ‘‘ Miss Harriet 
Vane, the well-known detective authoress,” she was interrupted by the 
telephone A familiar voice said, with a curious huskmess and 
uncertainty 

** Miss Harriet Vane ^ Is that you, Harnet ^ I saw you were 
back Will you dine with me one evenmg ^ ” 

There were several possible answers , among them, the repressive and 
disconcertmg ** Who is that speaking, please ^ ” Being unprepared and 
naturally honest, Harnet feebly replied 
** Oh, thank you, Peter But I don’t know whether 
48 



** What ^ said the voicCj with a hint of mockery ** Every night booked 
from now till the coming of the Coqcigrues ^ 

“ Of course not/* said Harriet, not at all willing to pose as the swollen- 
headed and much-run-aftei ceiebnty 
Then say when ** 

I*m free to-night/* said Harriet, thinking that the shortness of the 
notice might force him to plead a previous engagement. 

“ Admirable/* said he “ So am I We will taste the sweets of freedom. 
By the w^ay, you have changed your telephone number ** 

Yes , I*ve got a new flat ’* 

“ Shall I call for you ^ Or will you meet me at Feirara’s at 7 o’clock ^ 

“ At Ferrara’s ? ” 

“ Yes Seven o’clock, if that’s not too early Then we can go on to a 
show, if you care about it Till this evemng, then Thank you ” 

He hung up the receiver before she had time to protest Ferrara’s was 
not the place she would have chosen It was both fashionable and 
conspicuous Everybody who could get theie, went there , but its 
charges were so high that, for the present at least, it could afford not to 
be crowded That meant that if you went there you were seen If one 
intended to break off a connection with anyone, it was perhaps not the 
best opening move to afficher one’s self with him at Ferrara’s 
Oddly enough, this would be the first time she had dined in the West 
End with Peter Wimsey During the first year or so after her trial, she 
had not wanted to appear anywhere, even had she then been able to 
afford the frocks to appear in In those days, he had taken her to the 
quieter and better lestaurants in Soho, or, more often, earned her off, 
sulky and rebellious, m the car to such roadside inns as kept reliable 
cooks She had been too listless to refuse these outings, which had 
probably done something to keep her from brooding, even though her 
host’s imperturbable cheerfulness had often been repaid only with 
bitter or distressful woids Looking back, she was as much amazed by 
his patience as fretted by his persistence 
He received her at Ferrara’s with the old, quick, sidelong smile and 
ready speech, but with a more formal courtesy than she remembered in 
him He listened with interest, and indeed with eagerness, to the tale of 
her journeyings abroad , and she found (as was to be expected) that the 
map of Europe was familiar ground to him He contributed a few amus- 
ing incidents from his own expenence, and added some well-informed 
comments on the conditions of life in modem Germany She was 
surprised to find him so closely acquamted with the ins-and-outs of 
international politics, for she had not credited him with any great 
interest in public affairs She found herself arguing passionately with him 
about the prospects of the Ottawa Conference, of which he appeared to 
entertain no very great hopes , and by the time they got to the coffee she 
was so eager to disabuse his mind of some perverse opimons about 

49 



Disarmament that she had quite forgotten with what intentions (if any) 
she had come to meet him In the theatre she contrived to remind herself 
from time to time that something decisive ought to be said , but the 
conversational atmospheie remained so cool that it was difficult to 
introduce the new subject 

The play being over, he put her into a taxi, asked what address he 
should give the driver, requested formal permission to see her home and 
took his seat beside her This, to be sure, was the moment , but he was 
babbling pleasantly about the Georgian architecture of London It was 
only as they were running along Guilford Street that he forestalled her 
by saying (after a pause, during which she had been making up her mind 
to take the plunge) 

** I take It, Harriet, that you have no new answer to give me ^ ” 

“ No, Peter I*m sorry, but I can’t say anything else ” 

** All right Don’t worry I’ll try not to be a nuisance But if you could 
put up with me occasionally, as you have done to-night, I should be 
very grateful to you ” 

** I don’t think that would be at all fair to you ” 

“ If that’s the only reason, I am the best judge of that ” Then, with a 
return to his habitual self-mockery “ Old habits die hard I will not 
promise to reform Altogether I shall, with your permission, continue to 
propose to you, at decently regulated intervals — as a birthday treat, and 
on Guy Fawkes Day and on the Anniversary of the King’s Accession 
But consider it, if you will, as a pure formality You need not pay the 
slightest attention to it ” 

Peter, it’s foolish to go on like this ” 

** And, of course, on the Feast of All Fools ” 

It would be better to forget all about it — I hoped you had ” 
have the most ill-regulated memory It does those things which 
It ought not to do and leaves undone the tilings it ought to have done* 
but It has not yet gone on strike altogethei ” 

The taxi drew up, and the dnver peered round inquiringly Wimsey 
handed her out and waited gravely while she disentangled her latcii-key 
Then he took it from her, opened the door for her, said good night and 
was gone 

Mounting the stone staircase, she knew that, as far as this situation was 
concerned, her flight had been useless She was back in the old net of 
indecision and distress In hina, it appeared to have worked some kind 
of change , but it had certainly not made him any easier to deal with 


He had kept his promise, and troubled her very little He had been 
out of Town a good deal, hard at work upon cases, some of which 
trickled through into newspaper columns, while others appeared to settle 
themselves m discreet obscunty For six months he had himself been 
50 



out of the country, offering no explanation except business ” One 
summei, he had been involved in an odd affair, which had led him to 
take a post in an Advertising Agency He had found office life entertain- 
ing , but the thing had come to a strange and painful conclusion 
There had been an evening when he had turned up to keep a previously- 
made dinner appointment, but had obviously been unfit either to eat 
or talk Eventually he had confessed to a splitting headache and a 
temperature and suffered himself to be personally conducted home She 
had been sufficiently alarmed not to leave him till he was safely m his 
own flat and m the capable hands of Hunter The latter had been 
reassuring the trouble was nothing but reaction — of frequent occur- 
rence at the end of a tiying case, but soon over A day or two later, the 
patient had lung up, apologised, and made a fresh appointment, at 
which he had displayed a quite remarkable effervescence of spirits 
On no other occasion had Harriet ever passed his threshold Nor had 
he ever violated the seclusion of Mecklenburg Square Two or three 
times, courtesy had moved her to invite him in , but he had always 
made some excuse, and she understood that he was determined to 
leave her that place, at least, free from any awkward associations It was 
clear that he had no fatuous intention of making himself more valued by 
withdrawal he had rather the air of trying to make amends for something 
He renewed his offer of marriage on an average once in three months, but 
in such a way as to afford no excuse for any outbreak of temperament 
on either side One First of April, the question had arrived from Pans 
in a single Latin sentence, staiting off dispiritedly, “ Num ^ ** — 

a particle which notonously “ expects the answer No Harriet, 
rummaging the Grammar book for “ polite negatives*” replied, still 
more briefly, “ Benigne ” 

« 

Looking back upon her visit to Oxford, Harriet found that it had had 
an unsettling effect She had begun to take Wimsey for granted, as one 
might take dynamite for granted in a munitions factory But the dis- 
covery that tlie mere sound of his name still had the power to provoke 
such explosions in herself — that she could so passionately resent, at one 
and the same time, either praise or blame of him on other people^s lips 
— ^awakened a misgiving that dynamite was perhaps still dynamite, 
however harmless it might come to look through long custom 

On the mantelpiece of her sitting-room stood a note, in Peter’s small 
and rather difficult writing It informed her that he had been called 
away by Qucf-Inspector Parker, who was in difficulties over a murder m 
the north of England He must therefore regretfully cancel their appoint- 
ment for that week Gould she oblige him by mainng use of the tickets, 
of which he had no time to dispose otherwise ^ 

Harnet pinched her Ups over that last cautious sentence Ever since 

51 




one frightful occasion, during the first year of their acquaintance, when 
he had ventured to send her a Ghnstmas present and she, in an access 
of mortified pride, had returned it to him with a stinging rebuke, he had 
been careful never to offer her anything that could possibly be looked 
upon a. ^ material gift Had he been wiped out of existence at any 
moment, there was nothing among her possessions to remind her of him 
She now took up the tickets and hesitated over them She could give 
them away, or she could go herself and take a friend On the whole, she 
thought she would rather not sit through the performance with a kind 
of Banquo’s ghost disputing possession of the next stall with somebody 
else. She put the tickets m an envelope, dispatched them to the married 
couple who had taken her to Ascot, and then tore the note across and 
deposited it in the waste-paper basket Having thus disposed of Banquo, 
she breathed more freely, and turned to deal with the day’s next 
nuisance 

This was the revision of three of her books for a new edition The 
re-reading of one’s own works is usually a dismal matter , and when she 
had completed her task she felt thoroughly jaded and displeased with 
herself The books were all right, as far as they went , as intellectual 
exercises, they were even bnihant But there was something lacking 
about them , they read now to her as though they had been written 
with a mental reservation, a determination to keep her own opimons and 
personality out of view She considered with distaste a clever and super- 
ficial discussion between two of the characters about married life She 
could have made a much better thing of that, if she had not been afraid 
of giving herself away What hampered her was this sense of bemg in the 
middle of things, too close to things, pressed upon and bullied by 
reality If she could succeed in standing aside from herself she would 
achieve self-confidence and a better control That was the great 
possession m which — with all his limitations — the scholar could account 
himself blessed the single eye, directed to the object, not dimmed 
nor distracted by pnvate motes and beams “ Private, indeed ^ ” 
muttered Harriet to herself, as she smacked her proofs irritably into 
brown paper 

“You not alone, when you are still alone, 

O God, from you that I could private be ’ ” 

She was exceedingly glad that she had got rid of the theatre tickets. 

So that when Wimsey eventually got back from his expedition north, 
she went to meet him in a belligerent spirit He had asked her to dine 
with him, this time, at the Egotists’ Club — an unusual venue It was a 
Saturday night, and they had the room to themselves She mentioned her 
Oxford visit and took the opportumty to recite to him a list of promising 
scholars, distinguished m their studies and subsequently extinguished by 
5 « 



matrimony. He agreed mildly that such things did happen, far too often, 
and instanced a very brilliant painter who, urged on by a socially 
ambitious wife, had now become a slick machine for the production of 
Academy portraits 

“ Sometimes, of course,” he went on dispassionately, the partner is 
merely jealous or selfish But half the time it’s sheer stupidity They 
don’t mean it It’s surprisin’ how few people ever mean anything 
definite from one year’s end to the other ” 

“ I don’t think they could help it, whatever they meant It’s the 
pressure of other people’s personalities that does the mischief” 

Yes Best intentions no security They never are, of course You may 
say you won’t interfere with another person’s soul, but you do — merely 
by existing The snag about it is the practical diflSculty, so to speak, of 
not existing I mean, here we all are, you know, and what are we to do 
about It ^ ” 

“ Well, I suppose some people feel themselves called to make personal 
relationships their life-woik If so, it’s all right for them But what about 
the others ^ ” / 

“ Tiresome, isn’t it ^ ” he said, with a gleam of amusement that 
annoyed her “ Do you think they ought to cut out human contacts 
altogether ^ It’s not easy There’s always the butcher or the baker or 
the landlady or somebody one has to wrestle with Or should the 
people with brains sit tight and let the people with hearts look after 
them ^ ” 

** They frequently do ” 

So they do ” For the fifth time he summoned the waiter to pick up 
Harriet’s napkin for her “ Why do gemuses make bad husbands, and 
all that ^ But what are you going to do about the people who are cursed 
with both hearts and brains ^ ” 

“ I’m sorry I keep on dropping things , this silk’s so slippery Well, 
that’s just the problem, isn’t it ^ I’m beginning to believe they’ve got to 
choose ” 

“ Not compromise ^ ” 

“ I don’t think the compromise works ” 

‘‘ That I should live to hear any person of English blood blaspheme 
against compromise ’ ” 

“ Oh, I’m not all English I’ve got some bits of Scotch and Irish 
tucked away somewhere ” 

That proves you’re English No other race ever boasts of being 
mongrel I’m quite offensively English myself, because I’m one-sixteenth 
French, besides ail the usual nationalities So that compromise is in my 
blood However Should you catalogue me as a heart or a brain ^ ” 

“ Nobody,” said Harnet, “ could deny your brain ” 

“ Who denies it ^ And you may deny my heart, but I’m damned if 
you shall deny its existence ” 


53 



“ You argue like an Elizabethan wit — two meanings under one 
word 

“ It was your word You will have to deny sometiung, if you intend 
to be like Caesar’s sacrifice ” 

“ Caesar’s ? ” 

“ A beast without a heart Has your napkin gone again ^ ” 

No — It’s my bag this time It’s just under your left foot ” 

“ Oh • ” He looked round, but the waiter had vanished “ Well,” he 
went on, without moving, ‘‘ it is the heart’s office to wait upon the brain, 
but in view of ” 

‘‘ Please don’t trouble,” said Harriet, “ it doesn’t matter in the least ” 
“ In view of the fact that I’ve got two cracked ribs. I’d better not try , 
because if I once got down I should probably never get up again ” 

“ Good gracious ! ” said Harnct “ I thought you seemed a little stiff 
in your manner Why on earth didn’t you say so before, instead of 
sitting there like a martyr and mveiglmg me into misjudging you ^ ” 

“ I don’t seem able to do anything nght,” he said plaintively 
“ How did you manage to do it ? ” 

Fell ofiT a wall m the most martistic manner I was in a bit of a hurry , 
there was a very plain-looking bloke on the other side with a gun It 
wasn’t so much the wall, as the wheelbarrow at the bottom And it isn’t 
really so much tlie nbs as the sticking-plaster It’s strapped as tight as 
hell and itches infernally ” 

How beastly for you I’m so sorry What became of the bloke with 
the gun ? ” 

“ Ah • I’m afraid personal complications won’t trouble him any 
longer ” 

If luck had been the other way, I suppose they wouldn’t have 
troubled any longer ^ ” 

“ Probably not And then I shouldn’t have troubled you any longer 
If my mind had been where my heart was, I might have welcomed that 
setdement But my mind being momentarily on my job, I ran away 
with the greatest rapidity, so as to live to fimsh the case ” 

“ Well, I’m glad of that, Peter ” 

** Are you ^ That shows how hard it is for even the most powerful 
brain to be completely heartless Let me see It is not my day for asking 
you to marry me, and a few yards of sticking-plaster are hardly enough 
to make it a special occasion But we’ll have coffee in the lounge, if you 
don’t mind, because this chair is getting as hard as the wheelbarrow, 
and seems to be catchmg me in several of the same places ” 

He got up cautiously The waiter arrived and restored Harriet’s bag, 
together with some letters which she had taken from the postman as she 
left the house and thrust into the outer pocket of the bag without read- 
ing Wimsey steered his guest into the lounge, established her m a chair 
and lowered himself with a grimace into one comer of a low couch 
54 



“ Rather a long way down^ isn’t it ^ ” 

“ It’s ail right when you get there Sorry to be always presenting 
myself in such a decrepit state I do it on purpose, of course, to attract 
attention and awaken sympathy, but I’m afraid the manoeuvre’s getting 
rather obvious Would you like a liqueur with the coffee or a brandy ^ 
Two old brandies, James ” 

Very good, my lord This was found under the table in the dining- 
room, madam ” 

“ More of your scattered belongings ^ ” said Wimsey, as she took the 
post-card, then, seeing her flush and frown of disgust, “ What is it ? ” 
“ Nothing,” said Harriet, pushing the ugly scrawl into her bag 
He looked at her 

“ Do you often get that kind of thing ^ ” 

« What kind of thing?” 

“ Anonymous dirt ” 

“ Not very often now I got one at Oxford But they used to come 
by every post Don’t worry , I’m used to it I only wish I’d looked at 
it before I got here It’s horrible of me to have dropped it about your 
club for the servants to read ” 

“ Careless little devil, aren’t you ^ May I see it ? ” 

“ No, Peter , please ” 

“ Give It to me ” 

She handed it to him without looking up “ Ask your boy friend with the 
title if he likes arsenic in his soup What did you give him to get you ^ ” it 
inquired, disagreeably 

“ God, what muck ^ ” said he, bitterly “ So that’s what I’m letting 
you in for I might have known it I could hardly hope that it wasn’t so. 
But you said nothing, so I allowed myself to be selfish ” 

It doesn’t matter It’s just part of the consequences. You can’t do 
anything about it ” 

“ I nught have the consideration not to expose you to it Heaven knows 
you’ve tried hard enough to get rid of me In fact, I think you’ve used 
every possible lever to dislodge me, except that one ” 

Well, I knew you would hate it so I didn’t want to huit you ” 

** Didn’t want to hurt me ” 

She realised that this, to him, must sound completely lunatic 
“ I mean that, Peter I know I’ve said about every damnable thing 
to you that I could think of But I have my hnuts ” A sudden wav'-e of 
anger surged up in her “ My God, do you really think that of me ^ Do 
you suppose there’s no meanness I wouldn’t stoop to ^ ” 

‘‘ You’d have been perfectly justified m telling me that I was making 
thmgs more difficult for you by hanging round ” 

Should I ? Did you expect me to tell you that you were compromis- 
ing my reputation, when I had none to compromise ? To point out that 
you’d saved me from the gallows, thank you very much, but left me in 

55 



the pillory ^ To say, my name’s mud, but kindly treat it as lilies ^ I^'m 
not quite such a hypocrite as that ” 

“ I see The plain fact is, that I am doing nothing but make life a little 
bitterer for you it was generous of you not to say so ” 

Why did you insist on seeing that thing ” 

“ Because,” he said, sti iking a match and holding the dame to a corner 
of the post-card, “ while I am quite ready to take flight from plug-uglies 
with guns, I prefer to look other kinds of trouble m the face ” He dropped 
the burmng paper on to the tray and crushed the ashes together, and she 
was again reminded of the message she had found in her sleeve You 
have nothing to reproach yourself with — you didn’t tell me this , I 
found it out for myself I will admit defeat and say good-bye Shall I ^ ” 
The club waiter set down the brandies Harriet, with her eyes on her 
own hands, sat plaiting her fingers together Peter watched her for 
some minutes, and then said gently 
“ Don’t look so tragic about it The coffee’s getting cold After all, you 
know, I have the consolation that ‘ not you but Fate has vanquished 
me ’ I shall emerge with my vanity intact, and that’s something ” 

Petei I’m afraid I’m not very consistent I came here to-mght with 
the firm intention of telling you to chuck it But I’d rather fight my own 
battles I — I — ,” she looked up and went on rather quaveringly, “ I’m 
damned if I’ll have you wiped out by plug-uglies or anonymous-letter 
writers ^ ” 

He sat up sharply, so that his exclamation of pleasure turned half- 
way into an anguished grunt 

Oh, curse this sticking-plaster * Harriet, you have got guts, 
haven’t you ^ Give me your hand, and we’ll fight on until we drop 
Here * none of that You can’t cry m this club It’s never been done, 
and if you disgrace me like this, I shall get into a row with the Committee 
They’ll probably close the Ladies’ Rooms altogether ” 

“ I’m sorry, Peter ” 

And donH put sugar in my coffee ” 


Later in the evening, having lent a strong arm to extricate him, 
swearing loudly, from the difficult deptlis of the couch, and dispatched 
him to such rest as he might reasonably look for between the pains of 
love and sticbng-plaster, she had leisure to reflect that if fate had 
vanquished either of them it was not Peter Wimsey He knew too well 
the wrestler’s trick of letting the adversary’s own strength defeat itself 
Yet she knew with certainty that if, when he had said, “ Shall I go ^ ” she 
had replied with firm kindness, ‘‘ I’m sorry, but I think it would be 
better,” there \vould have been the desired end of the matter 

I wish,” she said to the friend of the Euiopean trip, “ he would take 
a firm Ime of some kind ” 

56 



“ But he has,’’ replied the friend, who was a clear-headed person 
“ He knows what he wants The tioubie is that you don’t I know it isn’t 
pleasant puttmg an end to things, but I don’t see why he should do all 
your dirty woiL for vou, particularly as he doesn’t want it done As for 
anonymous ietteis, it seems to me quite ridiculous to pay any attention 
to them ” 

It was easy for the friend to say this, having no vulnerable points in her 
busk and hard-w^orking life 

‘‘ Peter says I ought to get a secretary and have them weeded out ” 

“ Well,” said the friend, “ that’s a practical suggestion, anyway But 
I suppose, since it’s his advice, you’ll find some ingenious reason foi not 
taking it ” 

I’m not as bad as that,” said Harriet , and engaged the secretary 


So matteis went on for some months She made no further effort to 
discuss the conflicting claims of heart and biain That line of talk led to 
a perilous e'^cnange of personalities, in which he, with a Iiveliei wit and 
better self-contiol, could always diive her into a corner without exposing 
himself It w^as only by sheer brutal hacking that she could beat down 
his guard , and she was beginning to be afraid of those impulses to 
savagery 


She heaid no news of Shrewsbury College in the interval, except that 
one day in the Michaelmas Term there was a paragraph in one of the 
mole foolish London dailies about an “ Undergraduettes’ Rag,” 
informing the woild that somebody had made a bonfire of gowns in 
Shrewsbury Quad and that the “ Lady Head ” was said to be taking 
disciplinary measures Women, of couise, were always news Harriet 
wrote a tart letter to the paper, pointing out that either “ undergrad* 
uale ” or “ woman student ” would be seemlier English than " under- 
graduette,” and that the correct method of descnbing Di Baring was 
“ the Warden ” The only result of this was to provoke a correspondence 
headed “ Lady Undergrads,” and a reference to “ sweet girl-graduates 
She informed Wimsey — who happened to be the nearest male person 
handy for scarifying — that this kind of vulganty was typical of the 
average man’s attitude to women’s intellectual interests He replied that 
bad manneis always made him sick , but was it any worse than 
headlimng foreign monarchs by their Christian names, untitled ^ 


About three weeks before the end of the Easter term, however, 
Harriet’s attention was again called to college affairs in a way that was 
more personal and more disquieting 


57 



February was sobbing and blustering its lachrymose way into March^ 
when she received a letter from the Dean 

My dear Miss Vane, 

I am wnting to ask vou whetlier you will be able to get up to Oxford 
for the opening of the New Library Wmg by the Chancellor next 
Thursday This, as you know, has always been the date for the official 
opening, though we had hoped that the buildings themselves 
would be ready for habitation at the beginning of this temi However, 
what with a dispute m the contractors’ firm, and the unfortunate 
illness of the architect, we got badly held up, so that we shall only just 
be ready in tmie In fact, the intenor decoration of the ground floor 
isn’t finishedji>(?^— Still, we couldn’t very well ask Lord Oakapple to 
change the date, as he is such a busy man , and after all, the Library 
IS the chief thing, and not the Fellows’ sets, however badly they may 
need a home to go to, poor dears 

We are particularly anxious — I am speaking for Dr Baring as well 
as m>^elf— that you should come, if you can manage to find time 
(though of course >ou have a lot of engagements) We should be very 
glad to have your advice about a most unpleasant thing that has been 
happening here Not that one expects a detective novelist to be a 
practical policeman , but I know you have taken part in one real 
investigation, and I feel sure you know a lot more than we do about 
tracking down malefactors 

Don’t think we are all gettmg murdered in our beds » In some ways 
I’m not sure that a “ mce, clean murder ” wouldn’t be easier to deal 
with > The fact is, we are being victimised by a cross between a 
Poltergeist and a Poison-Pen, and you can imagine how disgusting it 
IS for everybody It seems that the letters started coming some time 
ago, but at fiist nobody took much notice I suppose everyone gets 
vulgar anonymous communications from time to time , and tliough 
some of the beastly things didn’t come by post, there’s nothing in a 
place like this to prevent an outsider from dropping them at the Lodge 
or even inside the College But wanton destruction of property is a 
different matter, and the last outbreak has been so abominable that 
somethmg really must be done about it Poor Miss Lydgate’s English 
Prosody — ^you saw that colossal woik in progress — ^has been defaced 
and mutilated in the most revolting manner, and some important 
manuscript portions completely destroyed, so that they will have to be 
done all over again She was almost m tears, poor dear — and the 
alarming thing is that it now looks as though somebody in college must 
be responsible We suppose that some student must have a grudge 
against the S G R — but it must be more than a grudge — it must be a 
very horrid kind of pettiness 

One can scarcely call m the police — if you’d seen some of the letters 

sB 



you’d realise that the less pubhcity the better, and you know how 
things get about I dare sa> vou noticed there was a wretched news- 
paper paragraph about that bonfire in the quad last November We 
never discovered who did that, by the wav , we thought, naturally, 
it was a stupid piactical joke , but wc are now beginning to wonder 
whether it wasn’t all part of the same campaign 

So if you could possibly snatch time to give us the benefit of your 
experience, we should be exceedingly grateful There must be som 
way of coping — this sort of persecution simply can’t go on But it’s an 
awfully difficult job to pm anything down m a place like this, with 
150 students and all doois open everywhere night and day 
I am afraid this is rather an incoherent letter, but I’m feeling that 
put about, with the Opemng looming ahead and all the entrance and 
scholarship papers blowing about me like leaves in Valiombrosa * 
Hoping very much to see you next Thursday, 

Yours very sincerely, 

Letitia Martin 

Here was a pretty thing * Just the kind of thing to do the worst possible 
damage to Umversity women — not only in Oxford, but everywhere In 
any commumty, of course, one always lan the risk of harbouring some- 
body undesirable , but parents obviously would not care to send their 
young innocents to places where psychological oddities flourished 
unchecked Even if the poison campaign led to no open disaster (and you 
never knew what people might be driven to under persecution) a washing 
of dirty linen in public was not calculated to do Shrewsbury any good* 
Because, though nme-tenths of the mud might be thrown at random, the 
remaimng tenth might quite easily be, as it usually was, dredged from the 
bottom of the well of truth, and would stick 
Who should know that better than herself^ She smiled wryly over the 
Dean’s letter “ The benefit of your experience ” , yes, indeed The 
words had, of course been written in the most perfect innocence, and 
with no suspicion that they could make the galled jade wince Miss 
Martin herself would never dream of writing abusive letters to a person 
who had been acquitted of murder, and it had undoubtedly never 
occurred to her that to ask the notorious Miss Vane for advice about how 
to deal with that kind of thing was to talk of rope m the house of the 
hanged This was merely an instance of that kind of unworldly tact- 
lessness to which learned and cloistered women were prone The Dean 
would be horrified to know that Harriet was the last person who should, 
m chanty, have been approached in the matter , and that, even in 

Oxford Itself, m Shrewsbury College itself 

In Shrewsbury College itself and at the Gaudy That was the point* 
The letter she had found in her sleeve had been put there in Shrewsbury 
College and at the Gandy Not only that , there had been the drawing she 

59 



had picked up m the quad Was either, or were both of these, part only 
of her own miserable quarrel with the world ^ Or were they rather to be 
connected with the subsequent outbreak in the college itself^ It seemed 
unlikely that Shiewsbury should have to harbour tivo dirty-minded 
lunatics m such quick succession But if the two lunatics weie one and the 
same lunatic, then the implication was an alarming one, and she herself 
must, at all costs, interfere at least so far as to tell what she knew There 
did come moments when all personal feelings had to be set aside m the 
interests of public service , and this looked like being one of them 

Reluctantly, she reached for the telephone and put a call through to 
Oxford While she waited for it, she thought the matter over m this new 
light The Dean had given no details about the poison letters, except that 
they suggested a grudge against the S G R and that the culprit appeared 
to belong to the college It was natural enough to attribute destructive 
ragging to the undergraduates , but then, the Dean did not know 
what Harriet knew The warped and repressed mind is apt enough 
to turn and wound itself “ Soured virginity ” — “ unnatmai life ” — 
“ semi-demented spinsters ” — “ starved appetites and suppressed 
impulses “ unwholesome atmosphere — she could think of whole 
sets of epithets, ready-minted for circulation Was this what lived m the 
tower set on the hill ^ Would it turn out to be like Lady Athaliah’s tower 
in Frohe Wind^ the home of frustration and perversion and madness ^ 
“ If thine eye be single, the whole body is lull of light ’’ — but was it 
physically possible to have the single eye ^ “ What are you to do with the 
people who are cursed with both hearts and brains ^ ” Foi them, stereo- 
scopic vision was probably a necessity , as for whom was it not ^ (This 
was a foolish play on words, but it meant something ) Well, then, what 
about this business of choosing one way of life ^ Must one, after all, seek 
a compromise, merely to preserve one^s sanity ^ Then one was doomed 
for ever to this miserable inner waifare, with confused noise and gar- 
ments rolled in blood — and, she reflected drearily, with the usual war 
aftermath of a debased coinage, a lowered efficiency and unstable 
conditions of government 

At this point the Oxford call came through, with the Dean’s voice 
sounding full of agitation Hainet, after hurriedly disclaiming all pre- 
tence to detecti've ability m real ]ife, expressed concern and sympathy and 
then asked the question that, to her, was of prime importance 

“ How are the letters written ^ ” 

“ That’s just the difficulty They’re mostly done by pasting together 
bits out of newspapers So, you see, there’s no handwriting to identify ” 

That seemed to settle it , there were not two anonymous correspond- 
ents, but only one. Very well, then 

“ Arc they merely obscene, or are they abusive or threatening 
too ? ” 

** All three Calling people names that poor Miss Lydgate didn’t know 
6o 



existed — the worbt she knows being Restoration Drama — and threatening 
everything from public exposure to the gallows ” 

Then the tower was Lady Athahah’s tower 
‘‘ Are they sent to anybody besides the SCR ^ ” 

It’s difficult to say, because people don’t always come and tell you 
things But I believe one or two of the students here have had them ” 

‘‘ And they come sometimes by post and sometimes to the Lodge ^ ” 
“ Yes And they arc beginning to come out on the walls now, and 
lately thev’ve been pushed under people’s doors at night So it looks as 
though It must be somebody in college ” 

When did you get the first one ^ ” 

“ The first one I definitely know about was sent to Miss de Vine last 
Michaelmas Teim That was her first term here, and of course, she 
thought It must be somebody who had a personal grudge against her 
But several people got them shortly afterwards, so we decided it couldn’t 
be that We’d never had anything of that sort happening before, so just 
at piesent we’re inclined to check up on the First Year students ” 

The one set of people that it can’t possibly be, thought Harriet She 
only said, however 

“ It doesn’t do to take too much for granted People may go on quite 
all right for a time, till something sets them off The whole difficulty with 
these things is that the person generally behaves quite normally m other 
respects It might be anybody ” 

“ That’s true I suppose it might even be one of ourselves That’s 
what’s so horrible Yes, I know — elderly virgins, and all that It’s awful 
to know that at any minute one may be sitting cheek by jowl with some- 
body who feels like that Do you think the poor creature knows that 
she does it herself^ I’ve been waking up with nightmares, wondering 
whether I didn’t perhaps prowl round in my sleep, spitting at people 
And my dear * I’m so terrified about next week * Poor Lord Oakapple, 
coming to open the Library, with venomous asps simply dripping poison 
over his boots ’ Suppose they send him something * ” 

“ Well,” said Harriet, “ I think I’ll come along next week There’s a 
very good reason why I’m not quite the light person to handle this, but 
on the other hand, I think I ought to come I’ll tell you why when we 
meet ” 

“ It’s terribly good of you I’m sure you’ll be able to suggest something 
I suppose you’ll want to see all the specimens there are Yes ^ Very well 
Every fragment shall be cherished next our hearts Do we handle them 
with the tongs for the better preservation of finger-prints ^ ” 

Harriet doubted whether fingei -prints would be of much service, but 
advised that precautions should be taken on principle When she had 
rung off, with the Dean’s reiterated thanks still echoing from the other 
end of the line, she sat for a few moments with the receiver in her hand 
Was there any quarter to which she might usefully turn for advice^ 

6x 



There was , but she was not eagci to aiscuss the subject of anonymous 
letters, still less the question of what li\rcd in academic tow^ers She hung 
up resolutely, and pushed the instmment away 


She woke next morning with a change of heart She had said that 
personal feeling ought not to stand in the way of public utility And it 
should not If Wmisey could be made useful to Shrewsbury College, she 
would use him Whether she liked it or not, whether oi not she had to 
put up with his saying “ I told >ou so,^* she would put her pride in her 
pocket and ask him the best way to go about the job She had her bath 
and dressed, glowing all the time with a consciousness of her own dis- 
interested devotion to the cause of truth She came into the sitting-room 
and enjoyed a good breakfast, still congratulating herself As she was 
fimshing her toast and marmalade, the secretary armed, bringing m the 
morning’s post It contained a hurried note from Peter, sent off the 
previous evening fiom Victoria 

Hauled off abroad again at a moment’s notice Pans first, then 
Rome Then God knows If you should want me— per impossibtle — you 
can get me through the Embassies, or the post-office will forward letters 
from the Piccadilly address In any case, you will hear from me on 
April ist 

P D B W 

Post occasto calm One could scarcely bombard the Embassies with 
letters about an obscure and complicated little affair in an Oxford 
college, especially when one’s correspondent was urgently engaged m 
investigating something else all over Europe The call must have been 
urgent, for the note was very ill and hastily written, and looked, m fact, 
as though it had been scribbled at the last moment in a taxi Harriet 
amused herself with wondering whether the Piince of Runtania had 
been shot, or the Master-Crook of the Continent had brought off a fresh 
coupi or whether this was the International Conspiracy to Wieck Civilisa- 
tion with a Death-Ray — all those situations being frequent in her kind 
of fiction Whatever it was all about, she would have to carry on unaided 
and find consolation in a proper independence of spirit 


CHAPTER V 

Virgimty is a fine picture, as Bonaventure calls it, a blessed thing 
in Itself, and if you will believe a Papist, meritorious And 
although there be some mconvemenccs, irksomeness, solitari- 
ness, etc , incident to such persons yet they are but toys

m respect, easily to be endured, if conferred to those frequent 
incumbrances of marriage And methinks sometime or other, 

amongst so many rich Bachelors, a benefactor should be found 
to build a monastical College for old, decayed, deformed, or 
discontented maids to live together in, that have lost their first 
loves, or olherw ise miscarried, or else are willing howsoever to 
lead a single life The rest, I say, are toys in respect, and 
sufficiently recompensed by those innumerable contents and 
incomparable privileges of Virginity 

ROBERT BURTON 

Harriet diove out to Oxford through a vile downpour of sleet that 
forced its way between the joints of the all-weather curtains and kept 
the windscreen-wiper hard at work Nothing could have been less like 
her journey of the previous June , but the greatest change of all was in 
her own feelings Then, she had been reluctant and uneasy , a prodigal 
daughter without the romantic appeal of husks and very uncertain of the 
fatted calf Now, it was the College that had blotted its copy-book and 
had called her m as one calls in a specialist, with litde regard to private 
morals but a despairing faith in professional skill Not that she cared 
much for the problem, or had very much hope of solving it , but she was 
able by now to look upon it as pure problem and a job to be done In 
June, she had said to herself, at every landmark on the way ” Plenty 
of time yet — thirty miles before I need begin to feel uncomfortable — 
twenty miles more respite — ten miles is still a good way to go ” This 
time, she was plainly and simply anxious to reach Oxford as quickly as 
possible — a state of mind for which the weather was perhaps largely 
responsible She slithered down Headington Hill with no concern 
beyond a passing thought for possible skids, crossed Magdalen Bridge 
with only a caustic observation addressed to a shoal of push-cyclists, 
muttered “ Thank God ’ ” as she reached the St Cross Road gate, and 
said “ Good afternoon cheerfully to Padgett the porter 
‘‘ Good afternoon, miss Nasty day it’s been The Dean left a message, 
miss, as you was to be put in the Guest Room over at Tudor and she was 
out at a meeting but would be back for tea Do you know the Guest 
Room, miss ^ That would be since your time, perhaps Well, it’s on the 
New Bridge, miss, between Tudor Building and the North Annexe where 
the Cottage used to be, miss, only of course that’s all done away now and 
you has to go up by the mam staircase past the West Lecture Room, 
miss, what used to be the Junior Common Room, miss, before they made 
the new entrance and moved the stairs, and then turn right and it’s 
half-way along the corridor You can’t mistake it, miss Any of the 
scouts would show you, miss, if you can find one about just now ” 

** Thank you, Padgett I’ll find it all right I’ll just take the car round 
to the garage ” 

63 



Don’t you trouble, miss Raimng cats and dogs, it is Fli take ner 
round for you later on She won’t ’urt m the sticel for a bit And Til have 
your bag up m half a moment, miss , only I can’t leave the gate till Mrs 
Padgett comes back from running over to the Butteiy, or Tm suie Fd 
show you the way myself ” 

Harriet again begged him not to trouble 

** Oh, it’s quite easy when you know, miss But what with pulling down 
here and budding up theie and altering this and that, there’s a many of 
our old ladies gets quite lost when they comes back to sec us ” 

“ I won’t get lost, Padgett ” And she had, in fact, no difficulty m 
finding the mysteiious Guest Room by the shifting stair and the non- 
existent Cottage She noticed that its windows gave her a commanding 
view over the Old Quad, though the New Quad was out of range and the 
greater part of the new Libiary Budding hidden bv the Annexe Wing of 
Tudor 


Having had tea with the Dean, Harriet found herself seated in the 
Senior Common Room at an informal meeting of the Fellows and Tutors, 
presided over by the Warden Before her lay the documents in the case — 
a pitiful little heap of dirty imaginations Fifteen or so of them had been 
collected for inspection There were half-a-dozen drawings, all much of 
the same kind as the one she had picked up on the Gaudy night There 
were a number of messages, addressed to various members of the SCR, 
and informing them, with various disagreeable epithets, that their sms 
would find them out, that they were not fit for decent society and that 
unless they left men alone, various unpleasing things would occur to 
them Some of these missives had come by post , others had been found 
on window-sills or pushed under doors , all were made up of the same 
cut-out letters pasted on sheets of rough scnbbhng-paper Two other 
messages had been sent to imdergraduates one, to the Senior Student, 
a very well-bred and inoffensive young woman who was reading Greats , 
the other to a Miss Flaxman, a brilliant Second-Year scholar The latter 
was rather more definite than most of the letters, in that it mentioned a 
name if you don’t leave young farringdon alone,” it said, adding 
an abusive term, “ it will be the worse for you ” 

The remaining items m the collection consisted, first, of a small book 
written by Miss Barton The Position of Women in the Modern State The 
copy belonged to the Library, and had been discovered one Sunday 
morning merrily burning on the fire in the Jumor Common Room in 
Burleigh House Secondly, there were the pi oofs and manuscript of Miss 
Lydgate’s English Prosody The history of these was as follows Miss Lyd- 
gate had at length transferred all her corrections in the text to the final 
page-proof and destroyed all the earlier revises She had then handed 
the proofs, together with the manuscript of the Introduction, to Miss 
64 



HiEfard, who lia,d undertaken to go through them with a view/ to verify- 
ing certain historical allusions. Miss Hilly ard stated that she had received 
them on a Saturday morning and taken them to her own rooms (which 
were on Miss Lydgate’s staircase and on the hoor immediately above). 
She had subsequently taken them into the Library (that is to say, the 
Library in Tudor^ now about to be superseded by the New liibrary), 
and had there worked upon them for some time vdth the aid of some 
reference books. Slie said she had been aione in tlie Libra.ry at the time, 
e^tcept for someone, whom she had never seen, who was moving about in 
the bay at the far end. Miss Hiliyard had then gone out to lunch in Hall, 
leaving the papers on the Librar>^ table. After lunch, she had gone on the 
river to put a group of First- Year students through a sculling- test. On her 
return to the Libraiy* after tea to resume w^ork, she found that the papei-s 
had disappeared from the table. She had at first supposed that Miss 
Lydgate had come in and, seeing them there, carried them oil to make 
a fe%v more of her celebrated corrections. She went to Miss Lydgate^s 
rooms to ask about them, but Miss Lydgate was not there. She said she 
had been a little surprised that Miss Lydgate should have removed them 
without leaving a note to say what she had done ; but she was not actually 
alarmed until, knocking again at Miss Lydgate’s door shortly before Hall, 
she suddenly remembered that the English Tutor had said that she was 
lea\dng before lunch to spend a couple of nights in Town. An inquiry 
was, of course, immediately set on foot, but nothing had come of it until, 
on the Monday morning, just after Chapel, the missing proofs had been 
found sprawled over the table and floor of the Senior Common Room. 
The finder had been Miss Pyke, who had been the first don to enter the 
room that morning. The scout responsible for dusting the S.G.R. was 
confident that nothing of the kind had been there before Chapel ; the 
appearance of the papers suggested that they had been tossed into the 
room by somebody passing the window, which would have been an easy 
enough thing for anybody to do. Nobody, however, had seen anything 
suspicious, though the entire college, particularly late-comers to Chapel 
and those students whose windows overlooked the S.G.R., had been 
interrogated. 

The proofs, when found, had been defaced throughout with thick 
copying-ink. All the manuscript alterations in the margins had been 
heavily blacked out and on certain pages offensive epithets had been 
written in rough block capitals. The manuscript Introduction had 
been burnt, and a triumphant note to this effect pasted in large printed 
letters across the first sheet of the proofs. 

This was the news with which Miss Hiliyard had had to face Miss 
Lydgate when the latter returned to College immediately after breakfast 
on the Monday. Some effort had been made to find out when, exactly, 
the proofs had been taken from the Library, The person in the far bay 
had been foimd, and turned out to have been Miss Burrows, the Libra- 


rian. She^ .however, said that she had not seen Miss Hillyard, who had 
come in after her and gone to lunch before her. Nor had she seen, or at 
any rate noticed, the proofs lying on the table. The Library* had not been 
very much used on the Saturday afternoon ; but a student who had gone 
in there at about 3 o’clock to consult Ducange’s Late Latin Dictionary, 
in the bay where Miss Hillyard had been working, had said that she iiad 
taken the volume down and laid it on the table, and she thought that if the 
proofs had been there, she would have noticed them. This student was a 
Miss Waters, a Second-Year French student and a pupil of Miss 
Shaw’s. 

A slight awkwardness had been introduced into the situation by the 
Bursar, who had seen Miss Hillyard apparently entering die Senior 
Common Room just before Chapel on Monday morning, hliss Hillyard 
explained that she had only gone as far as tiie door, thinking that she had 
left her gown there ; but remembering in time that she had hung it up 
in the cloakroom of Queen Elizabeth Building, had come out immedi- 
ately without entering the S.G.R. She demanded, angrily, whether the 
Bursar suspected her of having done the damage herself. Miss Stevens 
said, ** Of course not, but if Miss Hillyard had gone in, she could have 
seen whether the proofs were already in the room, and so provided a 
terminus a quo^ or alternatively ad quem^ for that part of the investigation.” 

This was really all the material evidence available, except diat a large 
bottle of copying-ink had disappeared from the office of the College 
Secretary and Treasurer, Miss Allison. The Treasurer had not had 
occasion to enter the office during Saturday afternoon or Sunday ; she 
could only say that the bottle had been in its usual place at one o’clock 
on Saturday. She did not lock the door of her office at any time, as no 
money was kept there, and all important papers were locked up in a safe. 
Her assistant did not live in college and had not been in during the 
week-end. 

The only other manifestation of any importance had been an outbreak 
of unpleasant scribbling on the walls of passages and lavatories. These 
inscriptions had, of course, been effaced as soon as noticed and were not 
available. 

It had naturally been necessary to take official notice of the loss and 
subsequent disfigurement of Miss Lydgate’s proofs. The whole college 
had been addressed by Dr. Baring and asked whether anybody had any 
evidence to bring forv^^ard. Nobody offered any ; and the Warden had 
thereupon issued a warning against making the matter known outside 
the college, together wdth an intimation that anybody sending indiscreet 
communications to eitlier the University papers or the daily press might 
find herself liable to severe disciplinary action. Delicate interrogation 
among the other Women’s Colleges had made it fairly clear that the 
nuisance was, so far, confined to Shrewsbury. 

Since nothing, so far, had come to light to show that the persecution 

66 



had started before the previous Octobei, suspicion rather naturally 
centred upon the First-Year students It was when Dr Bating had 
reached this point of her exposition that Harriet felt obliged to speak 

“ I am afraid. Warden/* she said, ‘ that I am m a position to mle 
out the First Year, and in fact Uie majority of the present students 
altogether ** 

And she proceeded, with some discomfort, to tell the meeting about the 
two specimens of the anonymous writer’s woik that she had discovered 
at and after the Gaudy 

** Thank you, Miss Vane,” said the Waiden, when she had finished 
“ I am extremely sorry that you should have had so unpleasant an 
experience But your information course narrov/s the field a great 
deal If the culprit is someone who attended the Gaudy, it must 
have been either one of the few present students who were then wailing 
up for vivas, or one of the scouts, or — one of ourselves ” 

Yes I’m afraid that is the case ” 

The dons looked at one another 

“It cannot, of course,” went on Dr Baring, “ be an old student, since 
the outrages have continued in the interim , nor can it be an Oxford 
resident outside the college, since we know that certain papers have been 
pushed under people’s doors during the mght, to say nothing of inscrip- 
tions on the walls which have been proved to have come into existence 
between, say, midnight and the next morning We therefore have to ask 
ourselves who, among the comparatively small number of persons in the 
three categories I have mentioned can possibly be responsible ” 

“ Surely,” said Miss Burrows, “ it is far more likely to be one of the 
scouts than one of ourselves I can scarcely imagine that a member of this 
Common Room would be capable of anything so disgusting Whereas 
that class of persons ” 

“ I think that is a very unfair observation,” said Miss Barton “ I feel 
strongly that we ought not to allow ourselves to be blinded by any sort 
of class prejudice ” 

“ The scouts are all women of excellent character, so far as I know,” 
said the Bursar, “ and you may be sure that I take very great care m 
engaging the staff The scrubbing-women and otheis who come in by the 
day are, naturally, excluded from suspicion Also, you will remember 
tiiat the greater number of the scouts sleep in their own wing The outer 
door of this is locked at mght and the ground-floor windows have bars 
Besides this, there are the iron gates which cut off the back entrance from 
the rest of the college buildings The only possible commumcation at 
mght would be by way of the buttery, which is also locked The Head 
Scout has the Leys Game has been with us fifteen years, and is 
presumably to be trusted ” 

“ I have never understood,” said Miss Barton, acidly, “ why the unfor- 
tunate servants should be locked up at night as though they were 

67 



dangero^is wild beasts, when everybody? else is free to come and go at 
pleasure However, as things are, it seems to be just as well for them 
“ The reason, as /ou very well know/'" replied the Bursar, is that 
there is no porter at the tradesmen’s entrance, and that it vvouM not be 
difhcult lo^ unauithoiised persons to climb over the outei gates And I 
Will remind >ou ^hat all the ground-fiooi windows that open directly 
upon the street or the kitchen yard aie haired, including those belonging 
to the Fellows As for the locking of the buttery, I may say that it is done 
to prevent- the students from raiding tne panti^ as they frequent!/ did in 
my predecessor’s time, or so I am informed The precautions arc taken 
quite as much against the membeis ol the college as against the scouts ” 
** How about the scouts ir the othei buildings ^ ” asked ihe Treasurer 
Tnure arc perhaps two or tiirce occupying odd bedrooms m each 
biuidmg/’ lepiled the Buisar * Tnev are all lehabie women who have 
been m our service since before my time I ha'^en’t the list here at the 
moment , but I thuik there aie thiee m ludoi, three o- four in Qpeen 
Elizabeth, and one in each of the four little dormer rooms in the New 
Quad Burleigh is all students’ rooms And there is, of course, the 
Warden’s own domestic staff, besides the Infirmary maid who sleeps 
there with the Infimianan ” 

“ I will take steps,” said Dr Banng, ** to make sure that no member 
of my own household is at fault You, Bursar, had better do the same by 
the Infirmary And, in their own i^iterests, the scouts sleeping in College 
had better be subjected to some kind of supervision ’ 

“ Surely, Warden began Miss Barton, hotly 

** In their own interests,” said the Warden, with quiet emphasis “ I 
entirely agree with you, Miss Barton, that there is no greater reason for 
suspecting them than for suspecting one of ourselves But that is the more 
reason why they should be cleared conipletely and at once ” 

By all means,” said the Bursar 

As to the method used,” went on the Warden, “ to keep check upon 
the scouts, or upon anybody else, I feel strongly that the fewer people w^ho 
know anything about that, the better Perhaps Miss Vare will be able to 
put forward a good suggestion, m confidence to myself or to ” 

“ Exactly,” said Miss Hiliyard, gnmiy ** lo whom ^ So far as I can 
see, nobody among us can be taken on trust ” 

** That IS unfortunately qmte true,*’ said the Warden, ” and the same 
thing applies to myself While I need not say that I have every confidence 
m the senior members of the College, both jointly and severally, it 
appears to me that, exactly as in the case of the scouts, it is of the highest 
importance that we should be safeguarded, m our own interests Wh^X 
do you say, Sub-Warden ^ ” 

“ Certainly,” replied Miss Lydgate “ There should be no distinction 
made at all I am perfectly wnlhng to submit to any measures of super- 
vision that may be recommended,” 

68 



** Welij you at least can scarcely be suspected/ said Uie Dean ‘® You 
are the gieatest sufferei 

We have nearly all suffered to some e\tent/* said Miss Hillyard 
“ I am afraid/’ said Miss Ailison ** \^e shall have to allow for what 1 
understand is the w^ell-known practice of these unfortunate — um, ah — 
anonymous-letter writers, of sending letteis to themselves to distract 
suspicion Isn^’t that so. Miss Vane ^ ’’ 

Yes/^ said Harriet, blunth “ h seems unlikely, on the face of it, that 
anybody w^ould do htrseif the kind of n^^atenal dan* age ]Miss Lydgate has 
received , but if w^e once begin to make distinctions it is difecult to know 
where to stop I don’t think anything but a plain ahbi ought to be 
accepted as evidence ” 

And I have no ahbi,” said Miss Lydgate “ I did not leave College 
on the Saturdav till after Miss Hiliyard had gone lo lunch What is more, 
I went over to Tudor duimg lunch-time, to return a book to Miss 
Chilperic’s room before I left , so that I might quite easily have taken 
the manuscript from the Library then 

‘ But you ha\e an alibi foi the time when the proofs were put in the 
S G.R /* said Harriet 

“ No,” said Miss Ly^dgate not even that I came by the early train 
and arrived when everybody was m Chapel I should have had to be 
rather quick to run across ana throw the proofs into the SCR and be 
back m my looms again before the discovery was made , but I suppose 
I could have done it In any case, I would much rather be tieated on the 
same footing as other people ” 

“ Thank you,” said the Warden “ Is there anybody wiio does not feel 
the same ^ ” 

** I am sure we must ail feel the same,” said the Dean “ But there i<’ 
one set of people we are overlooking ” 

“ The present students who were up at the Gaudy, ’ said the Watden 
Yes , how about them ^ ” 

“ I forget exactly who they were,” said the Dean, but I think most 
of them were Schools people, and have since gone down I will look up 
the lists and see Oh, and, of course, there M^as Jvliss Gattermoie who was 
up for Responsions — for the second time of asking ” 

Ah ’ ” said the Bursar “ Yes Gattermoie ” 

“ And that woman who was taking Mods — ^what’s her name ^ Hudson, 
isn’t It ^ Wasn’t she still up ^ ” 

“ Yes,” said Miss Hillyard, “ she was ” 

** They will be m their Second and Third Years now’-, I suppose,” said 
Harriet ’** By the way, is it known who * young Farringdon ’ is, in this 
note addressed to Miss Flaxman ? ” 

There’s the point,” said the Dean “ Y’oung Faiiingdon is an under- 
graduate of— New College, I thmk it is — who was engaged to Gattermoie 
when they both came up, but is now engaged to Flaxman ” 


60 



“ Is he, xndeed > 

“ Mainly, I understand, or partly, in consequence of that letter I am 
told that Miss Flaxman accused Miss Cattermole of sending it and showed 
it to Mr Farringdon , with the result that the gentleman broke off the 
engagement and transferred his affections to Flaxman 

“ Not pretty,'* said Harriet 

“ No But I don’t think the Cattermole engagement was ever anything 
much more than a family arrangement, and that the new deal was not 
much more than an open recogmtion of the fait accompli I gather there 
has been some feeling m the Second Year about the whole thing ” 

“ I see,” said Harriet 

“ The question remains,” said hrliss P>^ke, what steps do we propose 
to take in the matter^ We have asked Miss Vane’s advice, and personally 
I am prepared to agree — particularly in view of what we have heard this 
evening — that it is abundantly necessary that some outside peison should 
lend us assistance To call in the police authorities is clearly undesirable 
But may I ask whethei, at thxs stage, it is suggested that Miss Vane should 
personal! V undertake an investigation^ Or alternatively, would she 
propose our placing the mattei m the hands of a private inquiry agent ^ 
Or what ^ ” 

“ I feel I am in a very awkward position,” said Harriet “ I am wilhng 
to give any help I can , but you do realise, don’t you, that this kind of 
inquiry is apt to take a long time, especially if the investigator has to 
tackle It single-handed A place like this, where people run m and out 
everywhere at all hours is almost impossible to police or patrol efficiently 
It would need quite a little squad of inquiry agents — and even if you 
disguised them as scouts or students a good deal of awkwardness might 
arise ” 

“ Is tliere no material evidence to be obtained from an examination 
of the documents themselves ^ ” asked Miss Pyke “ Speakmg for myself, 
I am quite ready to have my finger-prints taken or to undergo any othei 
kind of precautionary measure that may be considered necessary ” 

Fm afraid,” said Harriet, the evidence of finger-prints isn’t quite 
so easy a matter as we make it appear m books I mean, we could take 
finger-prmts, naturally, from the SCR and, possibly, from the scouts — 
though they wouldn’t like it much But I should doubt very much 
whether rough scnbblmg-paper hke this would show distinguishable 
prints And besides ” 

“ Besides,” said the Dean, “ every malefactor nowadays knows enough 
about finger-prmts to wear gloves ” 

** And,” said Miss de Vine, speakmg for the first time, and wT.th a 
slightly grim emphasis, “ if we didn’t know it before, we know it 
now ” 

“ Great Scott ^ ” cried the Dean, impulsively, “ I’d forgotten all about 
it’s being us ” 

70 



“ You see what I meant/’ said the Waiden, ” when I said that it was 
better not to discuss methods of investigation too freely ” 

“ How many people have handled all these documents already ^ ” 
mquiied Hainet 

“ Ever so many, I should think,” said tlie Dean 

“ But could not a search be made for ” began Miss Chilpeiic She 

was the most jumor of the dons , a small, fair and nnoid young woman, 
assistant-tutor in English Language and Literature, and remarkable 
chiefly for being engaged to be married to a junior don at another 
college The Warden interrupted her 

® Please, Miss Ghilperic That is the kind of suggestion that ought not 
to be made heie It might convey a warning ” 

“ This,” said Miss Hiliyaid, “ is an intolerable position ” She looked 
angrily at Hairiet, as though she we^e lesponsible for the position , 
which, in a sense, she was 

“ It seems to me,” said the Treasuiet, “ that, now that we ha\ e asked 
Miss Vane to come and give us her advice, it is impossible for us to take 
it, or even to hear what it is The situation is rather Gdbertian ” 

“ We shall have to be frank up to a point,” said the Warden ** Do you 
advise the private inquiiy agent ]\Iiss Vane ^ ” 

Not the ordinary sort,” said Harriet , “ you wouldn’t like them at 
all But I do knov/ of an organisation where you could get the right type 
of pel son and the greatest possible discretion ” 

For she had remembered that there was a Miss Katherine Climpson, 
who ran what was ostensibly a Typing Bureau but was in fact a useful 
orgamsation of women engaged m handling odd little investigations The 
Bureau was self-supporting, though it had, she knew, Peter Wimsey’s 
money behind it She was one of the very few people in the Kingdom 
who did know that 
The Treasurer coughed 

“ Fees paid to a Detective Agency,” she observed, “ will have an odd 
appeal ance m the Annual Audit ” 

“ I think that might be arranged,” said Harriet “ I know the organ- 
isation personally A fee might not be necessary ” 

“ That,” said the Warden, “ would not be right The fees would, of 
course, have to be paid I would gladly be personally responsible ” 

“ That would not be right either,” said Miss Lydgate " We certainly 
should not like that ” 

Perhaps,” suggested Harriet, “ I couid find out what the fees were 
likely to be ” She had, in fact, no idea how this part of the business was 
worked 

“ There would be no harm m inquiring,” said the Warden “ In the 
meantime ” 

“ If I may make the suggestion,” said the Dean, I should propose. 
Warden, that the evidence should be handed over to Miss Vane, as she is 

71 



the only person m this loom who cannot possibly come under suspicion 
Perhaps blie would uLe to sleep upon the matter and make a repoi t to you 
m the morning A.t least, not in the morning, because of Lord Oakapple 
and the Opemng , bat at some time duimg to-morrow 

^ Very well,” said Hariie^, m response to an mquiimg look from the 
Warden I will do that \rd can think of an> way m which I can be 
helpful, ril do my best ” 

The Warden thanked hei ‘ We ail appreciate,” she added, the 
eictreme awkwardness of the situation, and I am sure we shall all do what 
we can to co-operate in getting the matter cleared up And I should like 
to say this Whatever anv of us mrv think or feel, it is of the very gieatest 
importance that we should d-smiss, as far as posbible, ah vague suspicions 
from cur minds, and be particularly caicful how we may say anything 
that might be construed as an accusation against anybody at all In a 
close community of this Lmd, nothmg can be more harmful than an 
atmosphere of mutual distrust I repeat that I have the very greatest 
confidence in everv^ Semoi Member of the College I shall endeavour to 
keep an entirely open mind, and I shall look to all my colleagues to do the 
same ” 

The dons assented , and the meeting broke up 


“ Weil f ” said the Dean, as she and Harnet turned into the New Quad, 
** that IS the most uncomfortable meeting I have ever had to sit through 
My dear, you have thrown a bombshell into our midst * ** 

“ I*m afraid so But what could I do ^ ” 

You couldn’t possibiv have done anything else Oh, dear * It’s all 
very well for the Warden to talk about an open mind, but we shall ail 
feel perfectly ghastly wondering what other people are thinking about 
us, and whether our own conversation doesn’t soimd a little potty It’s 
the pottmess, you know, that’s so awful ” 

“ I know By the way, Dean, I do absolutely refuse to suspect you 
You’re quite the sanest person I ever met ” 

“ I don’t think that’s keepmg an open mind, but thank you all the 
same for those few kind words And one can’t possibly suspect the 
Warden or Miss Lydgate, can one ^ But I’d better not say even that, I 
suppose Otherwise, by a process of elimmation — oh, lord ^ For Heaven’s 
sake can’t we find some handy outsider with a cast-iron alibi ready for 
busting ^ ” 

“ We’ll hope so And of course there are these two students and the 
scouts to be disposed of” They turned m at the Dean’s door Miss 
Martm savagely poked up the fire in the sittmg-room, sat down in an 
armchair and stared at the leaping flames Harriet coiled herself on a 
couch and contemplated Miss Martin 
** Look here,” said the Dean , “ you had better not tell me too much 



about wLat tlunk, but there’s no leason why any of us shouldn’t tell 
jfou what we think, is tlieie^ No Well Here’s the point What is the 
object of ail this persecution ^ It doesn’t look like a personal grudge 
against anybody m particular It’s a kind of blind malevolence, 
directed against ever>^body in College What’s at the back of it ? ” 

‘‘ Well, It might be somebody who thought the College as a body had 
injured her Or it might be a personal grudge masking itself under a 
general attack Or it might be just somebody with a mama for creatmg 
disturbance in older to enjoy the fun , that’s the usual reason for this 
kind of outbreak, if you can call it a reason ” 

“ That’s sheer pettiness, m that case Like those tiresome children 
who throw furmture about and the servants who pretend to be ghosts 
And, talking of servants, do you think there’s anytiung m that idea that 
It’s more likely to be somebody of that class ^ Of course, Miss Barton 
wouldn’t agree , but aftei all, some of the words used are very coarse ” 

“ Yes,” said Harriet , “ but actually there isn’t one that I, for example, 
don’t know the meamng of I beheve, when you get even the pnmmest 
people under an anaesthetic, they ar liable to bring the strangest voca- 
bulary out of the subconscious — m fact, the primmer the coarser ” 

“ True Did you notice that there wasn’t a smgle spelling mistake m 
the whole bunch of messages ^ ” 

** I noticed that It probably points to a fairly well educated person , 
though the converse isn’t necessarily true I mean, educated people often 
put m mistakes on purpose, so that spelhng mistakes don’t prove much. 
But an absence of mistakes is a more difiicuit thing to manage, if it doesn’t 
come natural I’m not putting this very clearly ” 

“ Yes, you are A good speller could pretend to be a bad one , but a 
bad speller can’t pretend to be a good one, any more than I could 
pretend to be a mathematician ” 

“ She could use a dictionary ” 

“ But then she would have to know enough to be dictionary-conscious 
— as the new slang would call it Isn’t our poison-pen rather silly to get 
all her spelling right ^ ” 

** I don’t know The educated person often fakes bad spelhng rather 
badly , misspells easy words and gets quite duBScult ones right It’s not so 
hard to tell when people are putting it on I think it’s probably cleverer 
to make no pretence about it ” 

“ I see Does this tend to exclude the scouts ^ But probably they 
spell far better than we do They so often are better educated And I’m 
sure they dress better But that’s ratiier off the point Stop me when I 
dither ” 

“ You’re not dithermg,” said Harriet “ Everything you say is per- 
fectly true At present I don’t see how anybody is to be excluded.” 

“ And demanded the Dean, becomes of the mutilated 

newspapers ^ ”

73 



“ This won’t do,” said Harriet , ** you’ie being a great deal too sharp 
about this That’s just one of the things I was wondenng about ” 

“ Weil, we’ve been into that,” said the Dean, in a tone of satisfaction 
“ We’ve checked up on all the S G R and J C R papers ever since this 
business came to our notice — that is, more or less, since the beginning of 
this term Before anything goes to be pulped, the whole lot are 
checked up with the list and examined to see that nothing has been cut 
out ” 

“ Who has been doing that ^ ” 

“ My secretary, Mrs Goodwin I don’t think you’ve met her yet She 
lives m College during term Such a mce girl — or woman, rather She was 
left a widow, you know, very hard up, and she’s got a little boy of ten at 
a prep school When her husband died — he was a schoolmaster — ^she 
set to work to tram as a secretary and really did splendidly She’s simply 
invaluable to me, and most careful and reliable ” 

“ Was she here at Gaudy ^ ” 

Of couise she was She — good gracious ' You surely don’t think — 
my dear, that’s absurd * The most straightforward and sane person And 
she’s very grateful to the College for having found her the job, and she 
certainly wouldn’t want to run the risk of losing it ” 

“ All the same, she’s got to go on the list of possibles How long has she 
been here ^ ” 

** Let me see Nearly two yeare Nothing at all happened till the Gaudy, 
you know, and she’d been here a year before that ” 

” But the S G R and the scouts who live in College have been here 
still longer, most of them We can t make exceptions along those lines 
How about the other secretaries ^ ” 

“ The Warden’s secretary— Miss Parsons — Olives at the Warden’s 
Lodgings The Bursar’s and the Treasurer’s secretaries both live out, so 
they can be crossed off ” 

“ Miss Parsons been here long ^ ” 

Four years ” 

Harriet noted down the names of Mrs Goodwm and Miss Parsons 
** I think,” she said, “ for Mrs Goodwin’s own sake we’d better have a 
second check on those newspapers Not that it really matters , because, 
if the poison-pen knows that the papers are being checked, she won’t use 
those papers And I suppose she must know, because of the care taken to 
collect them ” 

** Very likely That’s just the trouble, isn’t it ^ ” 

How about people’s private newspapers ^ ” 

** Well, naturally, we couldn’t check them We’ve kept an eye on the 
waste-paper baskets as well as we can Nothing is ever destroyed, you 
know It’s all thriftily collected in sacks and sent to the paper-makers or 
whoever it is that gives pence for old papers The worthy Padgett is 
instructed to examine the sacks — ^but it’s a terrific job And then of 
74 



course, smce there are fires in all the rooms, whv should anybody leave 
evidence in the W P B ^ ” 

“ How about the gowns that were burnt in the quad ^ That must have 
taken some doing Surely more than one person would have been needed 
to work that 

** We don’t know whether that was part of the same business or not 
About ten or a dozen people had left their gowns in various places — as 
they do, you know — before Sunday supper Some were in the Queen 
Ehzabeth portico, and some at the foot of the Hall stairs and so on. 
People bring them over and dump them, ready for evening ChapeL” 
(Harriet nodded , Sunday evemng Chapel was held at a quarter to 
eight, and was compulsory , being also a kind of College Meeting for the 
giving-out of notices ) “ Well, when the bell started, these people 
couldn’t find their gowns and so couldn’t go in to Chapel Everybody 
thought it was just a rag But in the middle of the night somebody saw a 
blaze in the quad, and it turned out to be a merry little bonfire of 
bombazine The gowns had all been soaked m petrol and they went up 
beautifully ” 

“ Where did the petrol come from ^ 

It was a can Mullins keeps for his motor-cycle You remember 
Mullins — the Jowett Lodge porter His machine lies in a little outhouse 
m the Lodge garden He didn’t lock it up — ^why should he ^ He does now, 
but that doesn’t help Anybody could have gone and fetched it He and 
his wife heard nothing, having retired to their virtuous rest The bonfire 
happened bang in the middle of the Old Quad and burnt a nasty patch 
in the turf Lots of people rushed out when the flare went up, and who- 
ever did It probably mingled with the crowd The victims were four 
M.A gowns, two scholars’ gowns and the rest commoners’ gowns , but 
I don’t suppose there was any selection , they just happened to be lying 
about ” 

“ I wonder where they were put in the mterval between supper and the 
bonfire Anybody carrying a whole bunch of gowns round College 
would be a bit conspicuous ” 

“ No , It was at the end of November, and it would be pretty dark 
They could easily have been bundled into a lecture-room to be left till 
called for There wasn’t a proper orgamsed search over college, you see 
The poor victims who were left gownless thought somebody was having 
a joke , they were very angry, but not very efficient Most of them 
rushed round to accuse their friends ” 

“ Yes , I don’t suppose we can get much out of that episode at this 
time of day Well — I suppose I’d better go and wash-and-brush-up for 
Hall ” 

Hall was an embarrassed meal at the High Table The conversation 
was valiantly kept to matters of academic and world interest. The under- 

75 



graduates babbled noisily and cheerfully , the snadow that rested upon 
the college did not seem to have affected their spirits Harrietts e>e 
roamed over them 

“ Is that Miss Cattermole at the table on the right ? In a green frockj 
with a badly made-up face ^ ” 

“ That’s the young lady,” replied the Dean ‘‘ How did you know ^ ” 
** I remember seemg her at Gaudy Where is the all-conquenng Miss 
Flaxman ^ ” 

I don’t see her She may not be dining m Hall Lots of them prefer 
to boil an egg m their rooms, so as to avoid the bother oi changing Slack 
little beasts And that’s Miss Hudson, in a red jumper, at the middle 
table Black hair and hoin runs ” 

“ She looks quite normal ” 

** So far as I krow, she is So far as I know, we all are ” 

“ I suppose,’ baid Miss Pyke, who nad overheard the last remark, 
“ even murderers look much hke othei people, Miss Vane Or do you 
hold any opimons about tlie tiieoiies put forward by Lombroso ^ I 
understand that they are now to a consideiable extent exploded ” 
Harriet was quite thankful to be allowed to discuss murderers 


After Hall, Harriet felt herself rather at a loose end She felt she ought 
to be doing something or interviewing somebody , but it was haid to 
know where to begm The Dean had announced that she would be busy 
with some lists, but would be open to receive visitors later on Miss 
Burrows the Librarian was to be engaged in puttmg the final touches to 
the Library befoie the Chancellor’s visit , she had been carting and 
arranging books tlie gi eater part of the day and had roped in a small 
band of students to assist her with the shelving of them Various other 
dons mentioned that they had work to do , Harriet thought they seemed 
a little shy of one another’s company 

Catching hold of the Bursar, Harriet asked whether it was possible to 
get hold of a plan of the college and a list of the various rooms and their 
occupants Miss Stevens offered to supply the list and said she thought 
there was a plan in the Treasurer’s ofEce She took Harriet across into 
the New Quad to get these things 

“ I hope,” said the Bursar, “ you will not pay too much attention to 
that unfortunate remark of Miss Burrows’ about the scouts Nothmg 
would please me more, personally, than to transfer all the maids to the 
Scouts’ Wmg ou^^ of reach of suspicion, if that were practicable , but 
there is no room for them there Certainly I do not mind giving you the 
names of those who sleep m College, and I agree, certainly, that pre- 
cautions should be taken But to my mind, the episode of Miss Lydgate’s 
proofs defimtely rules out the scouts Very few of them would be likely 
to know or care anything about proof-sheets , nor w'ould the idea of 
76 



mutilating manuscripts be likely to come into their hcadb Vulgar 
letters — ^yes, possibly But damaging those proofs was an educated 
person's crime Don't you think so ^ " 

I'd better not say what I think,” said Harriet 

“ No , quite right But I can say what / think I wouldn't say it to 
anybody out you Still, I do not like this haste to make scapegoats of the 
scouts ” 

The thing that seems so extraordinary,” said Harriet, “ is that Miss 
Lydgate, of all people, should have been chosen as a victim How could 
anybody — particularly one of her own colleaguea — ^have anv grudge 
against her ^ Doesn't it look rather as though the culprit knew nothing 
about the value of the proofs, and was merelv making a random gesture 
of defiance to the world m genc’-al ^ ” 

** That's possible, certainly I must say, Miss Vane, that your evidence 
to-day has made matters very complicated I would rather suspect the 
scouts than the S G R , I admit , but when these hasty accusations are 
made by the last person known to have been in the same room with the 
manuscript, I can only say that— well, that it appears to me injudicious.” 

Harriet said nothing to this The Bursar, appaientiy feeling that she 
had gone a httlc too far, added 

“ I have no suspicions of anybody All I say is, that statements ought 
not to be made without proof ” 

Harriet agreed, and, aftei marlung off the relevant names upon the 
Bursar's list, went to find the Treasurer 

Miss Allison produced a plan of the College, and showed the positions 
of the rooms occupied by various people 

** I hope this means,” she said, ** that you intend to undertake the 
investigation yourself Not, I suppose, that we ought to ask you to spare 
the time for any such thing But I do most strongly feel that the presence 
of paid detectives m this college would be most unpleasant, however 
discreet they might be I have served the College for a considerable 
number of years and I have its mterests %^ery much at heart You know 
how undesirable it is that any outsider should be brought into a matter 
of this kind,” 

“ It IS , ven%” said Harriet “ All the same, a spiteful or mentally 
deficient servant is a misfortune that might occur any^vhere Surely the 
important thing is to get to the bottom of the mystery as quickly as 
possible , and a trained detective or two would be veiy much more 
efficient than I should be ” 

Miss Allison looked thoughtfully at her, and swayed her glasses to and 
fro slowly on their gold chain 

“ I see you incline to the most comfoi table theory Probably we adl do 
But there is the other possibility Mind you, I quite see that from youf 
own point of view, you would not wish to take part m an exposure of a 
member of the Senior Common Room But if it came to the point, I 

77 



would put more faith in your tact than in that of an outside professional 
detective And you start with a knowledge of the workings of the 
collegiate system, which is a great advantage ” 

Harriet said that she thought she would know better what to suggest 
when she had made a preliminary review of all the circumstances 
“ If,” said Miss Allison, “ you do undertake an inqmry, it is probably 
only fair to warn you that you may meet with some opposition It has 
already been said — but perhaps I ought not to tell you this ” 

“ That IS for you to judge ” 

“ It has already been said that the narrowing-down of the suspects 
within the limits mentioned at to-day’s meetmg rests only upon your 
assertion I refer of course, to the two papers you found at the Gaudy ” 
“ I see Am I supposed to have invented those ^ ” 

“ I don’t think anybody would go as far as that But you have said that 
you sometimes receded similar letters on your own account And the 
suggestion is that ” 

That if I found anything of the sort I must have brought it with me 
That would be quite likely, only that the style of the things was so like 
the style of these others However, I adimt you have only my word for 
that ” 

“ Pm not doubting it for a moment What is being said is that your 
experience in these affairs is — if anything — a disadvantage Forgive me 
That is not what I say ” 

‘‘ That is the thing that made me very unwilling to have anythifig to 
do with the inquiry It is absolutely true I haven’t lived a perfectly 
blameless life, and you can’t get over it ” 

** If you ask me,” said Miss Allison, “ some people’s blameless lives 
are to blame for a good deal I am not a fool, Miss Vane No doubt my 
own life has been blameless as far as the more generous sins aie con- 
cerned But there are points upon which I should expect you to hold 
more balanced opimons than certain people here I don’t think I need 
say more than that, need I ^ ” 

Harriet’s next visit was to Miss Lydgate , her excuse bemg to inquire 
what she should do with the mutilated proofs in her possession She 
foimd the English Tutor patiently correcting a small pile of students’ 
essays 

“ Come in, come m,” said Miss Lydgate, cheerfully “ I have nearly 
done with these Oh, about my poor proofs ^ I’m afraid they’re not much 
use to me They’re really qmte imdecipherable I’m afraid the only thing 
is to do the whole thmg agam The printers will be tearing their ha^r, 
poor souls I shan’t have very much difficulty with the greater part of it, 
I hope And I have the lough notes of the Introduction, so it isn’t as bad 
as It might have been The worst loss is a number of manuscript footnotes 
and two manuscript appendices that I had to put in at the last moment 
to refute what seemed to me some very ill-considered statements in Mr 
78 



Elkbottom*s new book on Modem Verse-Form I stupidly wrote those in 
on the blank pages of the proofs and they are quite irrecoverable I shall 
have to verify all the lefeiences again in Eikbottom It’s so tiresome, 
especially as one is always so busy towards the end of term But it’s ail 
my own fault for not keeping a proper record of evervthing ” 

I wondei,” said Harriet, “ if I could be of any help to you in getting 
the proofs put together Fd gladK stay up for a week or so if it would do 
any good I’m quite used to juggling with proof-sheets, and I think I can 
remember enough of my Schools work to be reasonably intelligent about 
the Anglo-Saxon and Early English ” 

“ That would be a tremendous help * ” exclaimed Miss Lydgate, her 
face lighting up “ But wouldn’t it be trespassing far too much on your 
time ^ ” 

Harriet said, No , she was well ahead with her own work and would 
enjoy putting m a little time on English Prosody It was in her mind that, 
if she really meant to pursue mquiiies at Shrewsbury, Miss Lydgate’s 
proofs would offer a convenient excuse for her presence in College 
The suggestion was left there for the moment As regards the author of 
the outiages, Miss Lvdgate could make no suggestion , except that, 
whoever it was, the poor creature must be mentally afEicted 
As she left Miss Lydgate’s room, Harriet encountered Miss Hillyard, 
who was descending the staircase from her own abode 
** Well,” said Miss Hillyard, “ how is the investigation progressing ^ 
But I ought not to ask that You have contrived to cast the Apple of 
Discord among us with a vengeance Hol^ ever, as you are so well accus- 
tomed to the receipt of anonymous commumcations, you are no doubt 
the fittest person to handle the situation ” 

“ In my case,” said Harriet, “ I only got what was to some extent 
deserved But this is a very different matter It’s not the same problem 
at all Miss Lydgate’s book could offend nobody ” 

“ Except some of the men whose theories she has attacked,” leplied 
Miss Hillyard “ However, circumstances seem to exclude the male sex 
from the scope of the inquiry Otherwise, this mass-attack on a woman’s 
college would suggest to me the usual mascuime spite against educated 
women But you, of course, would consider that ridiculous ” 

“ Not m the least Plenty of men are very spiteful But surely there are 
no men runmng about the college at mght ” 

“ I wouldn’t be too sure of that,” said Miss Hillyard, smiling sarcas- 
tically It is qmte ndiculous for the Bursar to talk about locked gates 
What IS to prevent a man from concealing himself about the grounds 
before the gates are locked and escaping again when they are opened in 
the mormng ^ Or climbing the walls, if it comes to that ^ ” 

Hamet thought the theory far-fetched , but it interested her, as 
evidence of the speaker’s prejudice, which amounted almost to obsession 
“ The thing that in my opinion points to a man,” went on Miss 

79 



Hiilyard, “ is the destruction of Miss Barton’s book, which is strongly 
pro-femimst I don’t suppose vou have read it , probably it would not 
interest you But why else should that book be picked out ^ ” 

Harriet parted from Miss Hiilyard at the corner of the quad and went 
over to Tudor Building She had not very much doubt who it was that 
was likelv to offer opposition to her inquiries If one was looking for a 
twisted mind, Miss Hillyard’s was certainly a little warped And, w^hen 
one came to think of it, there was no evidence whatever that Mij>s 
Lydgate’s proofs had ever been taken to the Library or ever left Miss 
H*llyard’s hands at all Also, she had undoubtedly been seen on the 
threshold of the SCR before Chapel on the Monday morning If Miss 
Hiilyard was sufficiently demented to inflict a blow of this kind on Miss 
Lydgate, then she was fit for a lunatic asylum But, indeed, this woula 
apply to whoever it was 

She went into Tudor and tapped on Miss Barton’s door, asking, when 
she was admitted, whether she might borrow a copy of Woman^s Place in 
the Modem State 

“ The sleuth at work ^ ” said Miss Barton “ Well, Miss Vane, here it 
IS By the way, I should like to apologise to you for some of the things I 
said when you were here last I shall be very glad to see you handle this 
most unpleasant busmess, which can scarcely be an agreeable thing for 
you I admire exceedingly anyone who can subordinate her own. fcehngs 
to the common advantage The case is obviously pathological — as all 
anti-social behaviour is, in my opimon But here there is no question of 
legal proceedmgs, I imagine At least, I hope not I feel extremely 
anxious that it should not be brought into court , and on that account I 
am against hiring detectives of any kind If you are able to get to the 
bottom of it, I am ready to give you any help I can ” 

Harriet thanked the Fellow for her good opimon and for the book 
“ You are probably the best psychologist here,” said Harnet What 
do you think of it ^ ” 

‘ Probably the usual thing a morbid desire to attract attention and 
create a public uproar The adolescent and the middle-aged are the most 
likely suspects I should very much doubt whether there is much more to 
It than that Beyond, I mean, that the incidental obscemties point to some 
kitid of sexual disturbance But that is a common-place in cases of this 
kind But whether you ought to look for a man-hater or a man-trap,” 
added Miss Barton, with the fim glimmer of humour Harnet had ever 
seen in her, I can’t tell you ” 

Having put away her vanous acquisitions m her own room, Harnet 
thought it was lime to go and see the Dean She found Miss Burrows 
with her, very tired and dusty after coping with the Librai*v, and being 
refreshed with a glass of hot milk, to which Miss Martin insisted on 
adding ]ust a dash of whisky to mduce slumber 



“ What new light one gets on the habits of the SCR when one’s an 
old student,*' said Harriet ** I always imagined that there wa& only one 
bottle of ardent spirits in the college, kept under lock and key by the 
Buisar for iife-and -death emeigencies **’ 

It used to be so,” said the Dean, but Fm getting fiwclous m my 
old age Even Lydgate cherishes a small stock of cherry brandy, for 
high-days and holidays The Bursar is even thinking of laying dowm a 
little port for the College ” 

“ Gieat Scott * ” said Harriet 

“ The students are not supposed to rnibibe alcohol,” said the Dean, 
** but I shouldn’t like to go bail for the contents of all the cupboards in 
College ” 

“ After all,” said Miss Burrows, “ their tiresome parents bring them 
up to have cocktails and things at home, so it probably seems ridiculous 
to them that they shouldn’t do the same thing here ” 

And what can one do about it ^ Make a police search through their 
belongings ^ Weil, I flatly refuse We can’t keep the place like a gaol ” 

** The trouble is,’ said the Librarian, “that everybody sneers at 
restnctions and demands freedom, till something annoying happens , 
then they demand angrily what has become of the discipline ” 

“ You can’t exercise the old kind of discip^me in tliese days,” said the 
Dean , “ it’s too bitterly resented ” 

“ The modern idea is that young people should discipline themselves,” 
said the Libranan “ But do they ^ ” 

“ No , they won’t Responsibility bores ’em Before the War they 
passionately had College Meetmgs about everything Now, they won’t 
be bothered Half the old institutions like the College debates and the 
Third-Year Play, are dead or monbund They don’t want responsibility ” 
“ They’re all taken up with their young men,” said Miss Burrows. 

“ Drat their young men,” said the Dean “ In my day, we simply 
thirsted for responsibihty We’d all been sat on at school for the good of 
our souls, and came up buistmg to show how bnlliantly we could 
organise things when we were put m charge ” 

“ If you ask me,” said Harriet, “ it’s the fault of the schools Free 
discipline and so on Children are sick to death of runnmg things and 
doing prefect duty , and when they get up to Oxford they’re tired out 
and only want to sit back and let somebody else run the show Even in 
my time, the people from the up-to-date republican schools were shy of 
taking office, poor brutes ” 

“ It’s all very difficult,” said Miss Burrows with a ySLvm “ However, I 
did get my Library volunteers to do a job of work to-day We’ve got 
most of the shelves decently filled, and the pictures hung and the cur* 
up It looks very well I hope the Chancellor will be impressed 
They haven’t finished painting the radiators downstairs, but I’ve bimdled 
the paint-pots and things into a cupboard and hoped for the best And I 



borrowed a squad of scouts to clean up, so as not to leave anything to be 
done to-morrow ” 

“ What time does the Chancellor arrive ^ ” asked Harriet 

“ Twelve o’clock , reception in the S G R and show him round the 
College Then lunch in Hall, and I hope he enjoys it Ceiemony at 2 30 
And dien push him off to catch the 3 45 Delightful man , but I am 
getting fed up with Openings We’ve opened the New Quad, the Chapel 
(with choral service), the S G R Dimng-Room (mth lunch to Former 
Tutors and Fellow^s), the Tudor Annexe (with Old Students’ Tea), the 
Kitchens and Scouts’ Wing (with Royalty), the Sanatorium (ivith 
address by the Lister Professor of Medicine), the Councii-Chamber and 
the Warden’s Lodgings, and we’ve unveiled the late Warden’s Portrait, 
the Willett Memorial Sundial and the New Clock And now it’s the 
Library Padgett said to me last term, when we were making those alter- 
ations in Queen Elizabeth, ‘ Excuse me, madam Dean, miss, but could 
you tell me, miss, the date of the Opening ^ ‘ What Opening, Padgett ^ ’ 
said I * We aren’t opemng anything this term What is there to open ^ ’ 
‘ Well, miss,’ says Padgett, ‘ I was thinking of these here new lavatories, 
if you’ll excuse me, madam Dean, miss We’ve opened every^thing there 
was to open up to the present, miss, and if there was to be a Ceremony, 
miss, it would be convement if I was to know in good time, on account of 
arranging for taxis and parking accommodation * ” 

Dear Padgett ' ” said Miss Burrows “ He’s the brightest spot in this 
academy ” She yawned agam “ I’m dead ” 

“ Take her away to bed, Mss Vane,” said the Dean, “ and we’ll call it 
a day ” 


CHAPTER VI 

Often when they were gone to Bed, the inner doors were flung 
open, as also the Doors of a Cupboard which stood in the Hall , 
and this with a great deal of Violence and Noise And one Night 
the Chairs, which when they went to Bed stood all in the 
Chimney-corner, were all removed and placed in the middle of 
the Room in very good order, and a Meal-sieve hung upon one 
cut full of Holes, and a Key of an inner Door upon another And 
in the Day-time, as they sate in the House spinmng, they could 
see the Barn-doors often flung open, but not by whom Once, as 
Alice sate spmmng the Rock or Distaff leapt several times out of 
the Wheel into the middle of the room with much more 
such ndiculous stuff as this is, which would be tedious to relate

** Peter,” said Hariiet And with the soimd of her own voice she came 
drowsing and floating up out of the strong circle of his arms, through a 
green sea of sun-dappled beech-leaves into darkness 
** Oh, damn,” said Harriet sofdy to herself “ Oh, damn And I didn’t 
want to wake up ” 

The clock in the New Qjuad stiuck three musically 
“ This won’t do,” said Hairiet Thxs reall> will not do My sub- 
conscious has a most treacherous imagination ” She groped for the 
switch of hei bedside lamp “ It’s disquieting to reflect that one’s dreams 
never symbolise one’s real wishes, but always something Much Worse 
She turned the light on and sat up 

If I really wanted to be passionately embraced by Peter, I should 
dream of something hke dentists or gardening I wonder what are the 
unthinkable depths of awfulness that can only be expiesstd b> the poJite 
symbol of Peter’s embraces Damn Peter ’ I wonder w^hat he would do 
about a case like this ” 

This brought her mind back to the evemng in the Egotists’ Club and 
the anonymous letter , and thence back to his absurd fury vvith the 
sticking-plaster 

“ . but my mind being momentaniy on my job 
You’d think he was qmte bird-witted, sometimes, she thought But he 
does keep his mind on the job, when he’s doing it One’s mmd on the 
job Yes What am I doing, lettmg my mind stray all over the place Is 
this a job, or isn’t it ^ Suppose the Poison-Pen is on its rounds now, 
dropping letters at people’s doors Whose door, though ^ One 
can’t watch all the doors I ought to be sitting up at the window, 
keeping an eye open for creeping figures m the quad Somebody 
ought to do it — but who’s to be trusted ^ Besides, dons have their jobs 
to do , they can’t sit up all mght and work all day The job 
keepmg one’s mind on the job 

She was out of bed now and pulling the wmdow-curtams aside There 
was no moon, and nothing at all to be seen Not even a late essay-writer 
seemed to be burmng the midmght lamp 
Anybody could go anywhere on a dark mght hke this, she thought to 
herself She could scarcely see even the outline of the roofs of Tudor on 
her nght, or the dark bulk of the New Library jutting out on her left from 
behind the Annexe 
The Library , with not a soul m it 

She put on a dressmg-gown and opened her door softly It was bitterly 
cold She found the wall-switch and went down the central corridor of the 
Annexe, past a row of doors behind which students were sleeping and 
dreammg of goodness knew what — examinations, sports, undergraduates, 
parties, all the queer jumble of things that are summed up as 
“ activities ” Outside their doors lay litde heaps of soiled crockery for the 
scouts to collect and wash Also shoes On the doors were cards, bearing 

BS 



their nanie& JSfissH Broun, Mis& Jones, Miss Colburn, "Miss Szleposky, 
Miss Isaacson — so many unkroun quantities So many destined wives 
and mothers of the race , or, alternatively, so many potential historians, 
scientists, school-teachers, doctors, lawyers , as you liked to think one 
thing of more impox ranee than the other At the end of the passage was a 
large window, hygiemcallv open at top and bottom Harriet gently 
pushed up the bottom sash and looked out, shivering 

And suddenl-v she knew that whatever reason or instinct had led her 
to look at the Library had taken a veiy just \iew of the situation The 
New Library should ha\e been quite dark It was not One of the long 
windous was split from top to bottom by a narrow band of light, 

Harriet thought rapidly If tins was Miss Burrows, carrying on legiti- 
mately (though at an umeasonable and sacrificial hour) with her 
preparations, why had she troubled to d^aw the curtains ^ The windows 
had been curtained, because a Library that faces south must have some 
protection against strong sunlight But it would be absuid for the 
Librarian to protect herself and her propei functions from scrutiny in the 
ouddle of a dark JMarch mght College authonties were not so secretive 
as ail that Something was up Should one go and investigate on one’s 
own, or rouse somebody else ^ 

One thing was clear , if it was a member of tne SCR lurLng behind 
those curtains, it would not be politic to bring a student to witness the 
discovery What dons slept in Tudor ^ Without consulting the list, 
Hamct remembered that Miss Barton and Miss Ghilperic had looms 
there, but on the far side of the building Here was an opportumty to 
check up on them, at any rate With a last glance at the Library window, 
Harriet made her way quickly back past her owm room on the Bridge 
and through into the mam buildmg She cursed herself for not having a 
torch , she was delayed by fumbhng with the switches Along the corn- 
dor, past the stair-head and round to the left No don on that floor , it 
must be on the floor below Back, and down the stairs and along to the 
left agam She was lea\Ting all tlie passage-lights burmng belnnd her, and 
wondered whether they would arouse attention m other buildings At 
last, A door on her left labelled ** Miss Barton ” And the door stood open. 

She knocked at it sharply, and went in The sittmg-room was empty 
Beyond it, the bedroom door stood open too “ Gracious ’ said Harriet 
** Miss Barton * ” There was no reply , and, looking m, she saw that the 
bedroom was as empty as the sittmg-room The bed-clothes were flung 
*back and the bed had been slept in , but the sleeper had risen and gone 

It was easy to flunk of an innocent explanation Harriet stood for a 
moment, considering , ard then called to mmd that the window of tne 
room overlooked the quad The curtains were drawn back , she looked 
out mto the daikness The light btiU shone in the Library wmdow , but 
while she looked, it went out 

She ran back to the foot of the stair and through the entrance-hall 
84 



The front door oi the building uas ajar She pulled it open and ran out 
and across the quad As she ran, somellnrg seemed to loom up ahead of 
her She made for it and closed with it It caught her m a muscular grip 
** Who^s that ^ ” demanded Harriet, ^erceiy 
“ And who’s that ^ ” 

The grip of one hand was released and a torch was switched on m 
Harriet’s lace 

“ Miss Vane * What are you doing here ^ ” 

“ Is that Miss Barton ^ I was looking for you I saw a light in the New 
Library ” 

“ So did I I’ve just been over to investigate The door’s locked ” 

“ Locked?” 

“ And the key inside ” 

“ Isn’t there another way up ? ” asked Hainet 
“Yes, of course, there is I ought to have thought of that Up 
through the Hall passage and the Fiction Library Come along * ” 

“ Wait a minute,” said Hainet * Whoe\er it is may be still there 
You watch the mam door, to see they don’t get out tliat way I’ll go up 
through the Hall ” 

“ Very well Good idea Here * haven’t vou got a torch ? You’d better 
take mine You’ll waste time turning on lights ” 

Hamet snatched the torch and r<xn, thinking hard Miss Barton’s story 
sounded plausible enough She had woken up (wh> ?) seen the light 
(very likely she slept with her cui tains drawn open) and gone out to 
investigate while Harriet was runmng about the upper Boors hunting for 
the nght room In the meantime, the person m die Library had either 
fimshed what she was doing or, possibly, peeped out and been alarmed 
by seeing the lights go up m Tudor She had switched out the light She 
had not gone out by the main door , she was either still somewhere m the 
Hall-Library Wing, or she had crept out by the Hall staii while Miss 
Barton and Harriet were grappling with one another m the quad 
Harriet found the Hall stair ana started up it, using her torch as little 
as possible and keeping the light low It came forcibly into her mind that 
the person she was hunting was — must be — ^unbalanced, if not mad, and 
might possibly dehver a nasty swipe out of a dark corner She arrived at 
the head of the stair, and pushed back the smngmg glass double door 
that led to the passage between the Hall and the Buttery As she did so, 
she fancied she heard a shght scuffling sound ahead, and almost simul- 
taneously she saw the gleam of a torch There ought to be a two-way 
switch just on the right, behind tlie door She found it, and pressed it 
down There was a quick flicker, and then darkness A fuse ? Then she 
laughed at herself Of course not The person at the other end of the 
passage had flicked the switch at the same moment as herself She pushed 
the switch up again, and the lights flooded the passage 
On her left she saw the three doorways, with the serving-hatches 

85 



between, that led into the Hall On the right was the long blank wall 
between the passage and the kitchens And ahead of her, at the far end of 
the passage, close to the Buttery door, stood somebody clutching a 
dressing-gown about her with one hand and a large jug in the other 
Han let advanced swiftly upon this apparition, which came meekly 
enough to meet her Its features seemed familiar, and in a moment she 
identified them It was Miss Hudson, the Third Year student who had 
been up at Gaudy 

“ What in the world are you doing here at this time of mght ” 
demanded Harriet, severely Not that she had any particular right to 
question students about their movements Nor did she feel that her own 
appearance, in pyjamas and a jaeger dressing-gown, suggested digmty 
or authority Miss Hudson, indeed, seemed quite flabbergasted at being 
thus accosted by a total stranger at three in the morning She stared, 
speechless 

“ Why shouldn’t I be here ^ ” said Miss Hudson, at last, defiantly “ I 
don’t know who you are I’ve as much right to walk about as you have 
Oh, gosh ' ” she added, and burst out laughmg “ I suppose you’re 
one of the scouts I didn’t recognise you without your uniform ” 

“ No,” said Harriet, “ I’m an old student You’re Miss Hudson, 
aren’t you^ But your room isn’t here Have you been along to the 
Buttery ^ ” Her eyes were on the jug , Miss Huckon blushed 
“ Yes — I wanted some nulk I’ve got an essay ” 

She spoke of it as though it were a disease Harnet chuckled 
“ So that still goes on, does it ^ Game’s just as soft-hearted as Agnes 
was m my day ” She w'ent up to the Buttery hatch and shook it, but it 
was locked “ No, apparently she isn’t ” 

“ I asked her to leave it open,” said Miss Hudson, ‘‘ but I expect she 
forgot I say — don’t give Came away She’s awfully decent ” 

“ You know quite well that Game isn’t supposed to leave the hatch 
open You ought to get your milk before ten o’clock ” 

‘‘ I know But one doesn’t always know if one will want it You’ve done 
the same thing m your time, I expect ” 

** Yes,” said Harriet “ Well, you’d better cut along Wait a second 
When did you come up heie ^ ” 

‘'Just now Just a few seconds before you did ” 

“ Did you meet anybody ^ ” 

“ No ” Miss Hudson looked alarmed “ Why ^ Has anything 
happened ? ” 

Not that I know of Get along to bed ” 

Miss Hudson escaped and Hamet tried the Buttery door which was 
as firmly locked as the hatch Then she went on, through the Fiction 
Library, which was empty, and put her hand on the handle of the oak 
door that led to the New Library 

The door was immovable There was no key in the lock Hamet 

86 



looked round the Fiction Library On the window-sili lay a thin pencil, 
beside a book and a few papers She pushed the pencil into the key-hole , 
It encountered no lesistance 

She went to the WTindow of the Fiction Library and pushed it up It 
looked on to the roof of a small loggia Two people were not enough for 
this game of hide-and-seek She pulled a table across the Library door, 
so that if anybody tried to come out that way behind her back she should 
have notice of it , then she climbed out on to the loggia roof and leaned 
over the balcony She could see nothing distmctly beneath her, but she 
pulled her torch from her pocket and signalled with it 

** Hullo * ” said Miss Barton’s voice, cautiously, from below 

“ The other door’s locked, and the key gone ” 

“ That’s awkward If either of us goes, somebody may come out And 
if we yell for help there’ll be an uproar ” 

** That’s about the size of it,” said Harriet 

“ Well, listen , I’ll try and get in through one of the giound-floor 
wmdows They all seem to be latched, but I might break a pane of 
glass ” 

Harriet waited Presently she heard a faint tinkle Then there w^as a 
pause, and presently the sound of a moving sash There was a longer 
pause. Harriet came back into the Fiction Library and pulled the table 
away from the door In about six or seven minutes’ time she saw the door 
handle move and heard a tap on the other side of the oak She stooped to 
the key-hole, and called What’s up ^ ” and bent her ear to listen 

** Nobody here,” said Miss Barton’s voice on the other side “ Key’s 
gone And the most ghastly mess-up ” 

‘‘ I’ll come round ” 

She burned back through the Hall and round to the front of the 
Library Here she found the window that !Miss Barton had opened, 
climbed through and lan on up the stairs into the Library 

“ Well » ” said Harriet 

The New Libiary was a handsome, lofty room, with six bays on the 
South side, lit by as many wmdows runmng nearly from the floor to the 
ceiling On the North side, the wall was wmdowless, and sheh ed to a 
height of ten feet Above this was a space of blank wall, along wrhich *t 
would be possible, at some future time, to run an extra gallery when the 
books should become too many for the existent shelving This blank space 
had been adorned by Miss Bunows and her party with a senes of engrav- 
ings, such as every academic community possesses, representing the 
Parthenon, the Colosseum, Trajan’s Column and other topographical 
and classical subjects 

All the books m the room had been dragged out and flung on the 
floor, by the simple expedient of removing the shelves bodily The 
pictures had been thrown down And the blank w^all-space thus exposed 
had been adorned with a fneze of drawings, roughly executed m brown 

87 



paint, and with inscriptions in letters a foot high, all of the most unseemly 
sort A pair of hbiaiy steps and a pot of paint with a wide biush m it 
stood inumphantly in the midst of the wreckage, to show how the 
transformation had been accomplished 
I hat’s torn it,” said Haniet 

“ Yes,” said Khss Baiton “ A very’- mce reception for Lord Oakapple ” 
There was an odd note in liei \ oice — almost of satisfaction Harriet 
looLect sharpl) at her 

What are you going to do ^ What does one do ^ Go over the place 
with a magmfymg glass ^ or send for the police ^ ” 

“ Ncjither,” said Harriet She considered for a moment 
“ The first thing,” she said, * is to send for the Dean The next is to 
find either the original keys or a spare set The third, is to clean off these 
filtiiv inscnptions before anybody sees them And the fourth is to get the 
room straight before twelve o’clock There’s plenty oi time Will you be 
good enough to wake the Dean and bring her with you In the meantime, 
I’ll have a look round for clues We can discuss afterwards who did the 
job and how she got out Please make haste ” 

“ H’m * ” said the Fellow “ I hke people who know their own minds ” 
She went with surprising promptness 

“ Her dressmg-gown is all over paint,” said Harriet aloud to herself 
But she may have got it climbing in ” She went downstairs and 
examined the open window Yes, here’s where she scrambled over the 
wet radiator I expect I’m marked too Yes, I am Nothing to show 
whetlicr it all came from there Damp footmarks — ^hers and mine, no 
doubt Wait a moment ” 

She traced the damp marks up to the top of the stairs, where they grew 
faint and ceased She could find no third set , but the footmarks of the 
mtruder would probably have had time to dry Whoever it was must have 
begun operations very soon after midnight at latest The paint had 
splashed about a good deal , if it were possible to search the whole 
college for pamt-stained clothing, well and good But it would cause a 
tcrnfic scandal Miss Hudson — ^had she shown any marks of paint 
anywhere ^ Hamet thought not 

She looked about her agam, and realised unexpectedly that she had 
the lights full on, and that the curtains were drawn open If anybody was 
looking across from one of the other buildings, the mtenor of the room 
would show up like a lighted stage She snapped the lights off, and drew 
the curtains agam carefully before putting them on again 

“ Yes,” she said “ I see That was the idea The curtains were drawn 
while the job was done Then the hghts were turned off and the curtains 
opened. Then the artist escaped, leaving the doors locked In the morn- 
ing, everything would look quite ordmary from the outside Who would 
have been the first to try to come in ^ An early scout, to do a final clean 
round ^ She would find the door locked, think Miss Burro vvs had left it 
38 



like thatj and probablv do nothing about it Miss Burrows would 
probably have come up first When > A little after Chapel, or a little 
before She would not have been able to get in Time would have been 
wasted hunting for the Leys When anybody did get in, it would have 
been too late to straighten things up Everybody would have been about 
rhe Chancellor ^ 

Miss Burrow'S would have been the first to come up She had also been 
the last to leave, and was the person who knew best where the paint pots 
had been put Would she have wrecked her own job, any more than Miss 
Lydgate would have wrecked her own proofs ^ How fai was that psycho- 
logical premise sound ^ One would surely damage anything m the 
world, except one’s own work But on the other iiand, if one w'ere cunning 
enough to see that people would think exactly that, then one would 
promptly take the precaution of seeing that one’s own work did suffer ” 

Hainet moved slowly about the Library There was a big splash of 
pamt on the parquet And at the edge of it — oh, yes * it would be very 
useful to hunt the place over for paint-stamed clothes But here was 
evidence that the culprit had worn no slippers Whv should she have 
worn anything ^ The radiators on this floor were working at full blast, 
and a complete absence of clothing would be not merely pohtic but 
comfortable 

And how had the person got away ^ Neither Miss Hudson (if she was 
to be trusted) nor Harriet had met anyone on the way up But there had 
been plenty of time for escape, after the lights were put out A stealthy 
figure creeping away under the Hall archway could not have been seen 
from the far side of the Old Quad Or, if it came to that, there might 
quite well have been somebody lurkmg m the Hall while Harriet and 
Miss Hudson were talking in the passage 

“ I Ve mucked it a bit,” said Harriet ‘‘ I ought to have turned on the 
Hall lights to make sure ” 

Miss Barton re-entered with the Dean, who took one look round and 
said “ Mercy * ” She looked like a stout little mandarin, with her long 
red pigtail and quilted blue dressing-gowm sprawled over with green- 
and-scarlet dragons “ What idwts we were not to expect it Of course, 
the obmous thing ! If we’d only thought about it. Miss Burrows could have 
locked up before she went And wkat do we do now ^ ’ 

My first reaction,” said Harriet, ‘‘ is turpentine And the second is 
Padgett.” 

** My dear, you are perfectly nght Padgett will cope He always does 
Like charity, he never fails What a mercy you people spotted what was 
gomg on As soon as we get these disgusting mscnptions cleaned off, we 
can put on a coat of qmck-drymg distemper or something, or paper the 
wall over, and — ^goodness ^ I don’t know where the turpentine will come 
from, unless the pamters have left a lot It’ll need a young bath But 
Padgett will manage ” 


S9 



‘ I’ll run over and get him,” said Harriet, “ and at the same time I’ll 
collar Miss Burrows We’ll have to get these books back into place Whafs 
the time ^ Five to four I think it can be done all right Will you hold the 
fort till I come back ^ ” 

“ Yes Oh, and you’ll find the mam door open now I had an extia 
key, fortunately A beautiful plated key— all ready for Lord Oakapple 
But v/e’ll have to get a locksmith to the other door, unless the bmldeis 
have a spare ” 


The most remarkable thing about that remarkable moimng was the 
imperturbability of Padgett He answered Harriet’s summons attned in 
a handsome pair of striped pyjamas, and received her instructions with 
monumental stolidity 

“ The Dean is soriy to say, Padgett, that somebody has been piaving 
some very disagreeable tricks m the New Library ” 

“ Have they indeed miss ^ ” 

“ The whole place has been turned upside down, and some veiy*- 
vulgai words and pictmes sciawled on the wall ” 

Very unfortunate, nuss, that is ” 

In brown paint ” 

“ That’s awkward, miss ” 

It will have to be cleaned at once, before anybody sees it ” 

“ Very good, miss ” 

“ And then we shall have to get hold of the decorators or somebody to 
paper or wash it over before the Chancellor arrives ” 

“ Very good, miss ” 

* Do you think you can manage it, Padgett ^ ” 

“ Just you leave it to me, miss ” 

Harnet’s next job was to collect Miss Burrows, who received the news 
with loud expressions of annoyance 
“ How loathsome ’ And do you mean to say all those books have got 
to be done again ^ Now ^ Oh, lord, yes — I suppose there’s no help for it 
What a blessing I hadn’t put the Folio Chaucer and the other valuables 
in the show-cases Lord • ” 

The Librarian scrambled out of bed Harriet looked at her feet They 
were quite clean But there was an odd smell m the bedroom She traced 
It after a moment or two to the neighbourhood of the permanent basm 
** I say — is that turps ^ ” 

Yes,” replied Miss Burrows, strugghng into her stockmgs “ I brought 
it across from the Library I got paint on my hands when I moved those 
pots and things ” 

** I wish you’d lend it me We had to scramble m through the v\rmdow 
over a wet radiator ” 

90 



“ Yes, rather ” 

Harriet went out, puzzled Why should Miss Burrows have bothered 
to bring the can over to the New Quad, when she could have cleaned ofif 
the paint on the spot ^ But she could well understand that if anyone had 
wanted to remove paint from her feet, after being disturbed m the middle 
of a piece of dirty work, there might have been nothing for it but to 
snatch up the can and bolt for it 

Then she had anothei idea The culprit could not have left the 
Library with her feet bare She would have put on her slippers again If 
you put pamt-stamed feet into slippers, the slippers ought to show signs 
of It 

She went back to her own room and dressed Then she returned to the 
New Quad Miss Burrows had gone Her bedroom slippers lay by the 
bed Harriet exarmned them minutely, inside and out, but they were 
quite free from paint 

On her way back again, Harriet oveitook Padgett He was walking 
sedately across the lawn, carrying a large can of turpentine m each hand 

“ Where did you lake that up, Padgett, so early in the morning ^ ” 

“ Well, miss, Mullins went on his motor-bike and knocked up a chap 
he knowi's what hves over his own oxl-shop, miss ** 

As simple as that 


Some time later, Harriet and the Dean, decorously robed and gowned, 
found themselves passing along the East side of Queen Elizabeth 
Building in the wake of Padgett and the decorators* foreman 
“ Young ladies,” Padgett was heard to sa>, ** wall ’ave their larks, same 
as young gentlemen ** 

“ When I was a lad,” replied the foreman, young ladies was young 
ladies And young gentlemen was young gentlemen If you get my

By the time Lord Oakapple arrived, the Library piesented nothing 
unseemly to the eye, beyond a certain dampness and streakmess in its 
upper parts, where the new paper was drying unevenly The glass had 
been swept up and the paint stains cleaned from the floor , twenty 
photographs of classical statuary had been unearthed from a store- 

91 



cupboard to replace the Colosseum and the Parthenon j the books were 
back on their shelves, and the show-cases duly displayed the Chaucer 
Folio, the Shakespeare First Quaito, the three Kelmscott Moxiises, the 
autographed copy of Tlie Man of Property^ and the embroidered glove 
belonging to the Countess of Shrewsbury 
The Dean hovered about the Chancellor like a hen with one chick, 
in a martyrdom of nervous apprehension lest some indelicate missive 
should drop from his table-napkin or flutter out unexpectedly from the 
folds of hiS robes , and when, m the Senior Common Room after luncii, 
he took out a bunch of notes from his pocket and rifhed them o\er with 
a puzzled frown, the tension became so acute that she nearly dropped the 
sugar-basin It turned out, however, that he had merely mislaid a Greek 
quotation The Warden, though the history of the Library was known to 
her, displayed her usual serene poise 
Harriet saw nothing of all this She spent the whole interval, after the 
decorators had done their part, in the Library, watching the movements 
of every one who came m or out, and seeing that they left nothing 
undesirable behind them 

Apparently, however, the College Poltergeist had shot its bolt A cold 
lunch was brought up to the self-appointed invigilator A napkin covered 
It ; but nothing lurked beneath its folds beyond a plate of ham sandwiches 
and other such harmless matter Harriet recognised the scout 
** It’s Annie, isn’t it ^ Are you on the kitchen staff now ^ ” 

“ No, madam I wait upon the Hall and Senior Common Room ” 

“ How are your little girls getting on ^ I think Miss Lydgate said you 
bad two little girls ^ ” 

Yes, madam. How kmd of you to ask.” Anmc’s face beamed with 
pleasure “ They’re splendid Oxford suits them, after hving in a 
manufactunng town, where we were before Are you fond of children, 
madam ^ ” 

Oh, yes,” said Harriet Actually, she did not care much about 
children , but one can scarcely say so, bluntly, to those possessed of these 
blessings 

“ You ought to be married and have some of your own, madam 
There ^ I oughtn’t to have said that — ^it’s not my place But il seenais to me 
a dreadful thing to see all these unmarried ladies livmg together It isn’t 
natural, is it ^ ” 

“ Wdl, Annie, it’s all according to taste And one has to wait for the 
right person to come along ” 

** That’s very true, madam ” Harriet suddenly recollected that Annie’s 
husband had been queer, or conamitted suicide, or something unfortu- 
nate, and wondered whether her commonplace had been a tactful one 
But Anme seemed quite pleased with it She smiled again , she had 
large, light blue eyes, and Hamet thought she must have been a good- 
looking woman b^orc she got so thin and womed-looking, ** I’m sure 



I hope he’il come along for you — or perhaps you are engaged to be 
married 

Harnet frowned She had no particular liking for the question, and did 
not want to discuss her private affairs with the college servants But 
theie seemed to be no impertinent intention behind the inquiry, so she 
answered pleasantly, “ Not just yet , but you never know How do you 
like the new Library ^ 

“ It’s a very handsome room, isn’t it, madam ^ But it seems a great 
shame to keep up this big place just for women to study books in I can’t 
sec what girls want with books Books won’t teach them to be good 
waives ” 

“ What dreadful opimons • ” said Harriet “ Whatever made you take 
a job m a w^omen’s college, Anme ^ ” 

The scout’s face clouded “ Well, madam, I’ve had my misfortunes 
I was glad to take what I could get ” 

** Yes, of course , I was only joking Do you like the work ^ ” 

“ It’s quite all right But some of these clever ladies are a bit queer, 
don’t you think, madam ^ Funny, I mean No heart m them ” 

Harnet remembered that theie had been misunderstandings with 
Miss Hiliyard 

“ Oh, no,” she said briskly “ Of course they are very busy people, and 
haven’t much time for outside interests But they are all very kind ” 

“ Yes, madam , I’m sure they mean to be But I always think of what 
It says m the Bible, about * much learning hath made thee mad ’ It isn’t 
a right thing ” 

Harriet looked up sharply and caught an odd look m the scout’s eyes 
** What do you mean by that, Anme ^ ” 

” Nothing at all, madam Only funny things go on sometimes, but of 
course, being a visitor, you wouldn’t know, and it’s not my place to 
mention them — being only a servant, nowadays ” 

“ I certainly,” said Harnet, rather alarmed, wouldn’t mention any- 
thing of the kind you suggest to outside people or visitors If you have any 
complamt to make, you should speak to the Bursar, or the Warden ” 

I haven’t any complaint, madam But you may have heard about 
rude words being witten up on the walls, and about the things that were 
burnt in the Quad — why, there was a bit in the papers about that Well 
you’ll find, madam, they all happened since a certain person came into 
the college ” 

What person ^ ” said Harnet srernly 
“ One of these learned ladies, madam Well, perhaps I’d better not 
say anything more about that You write detective books, don’t you, 
madam ^ Well, you’ll find something m that lady’s past, you may be 
sure of It At least, that’s what a good many people are saying And it 
isn’t a nice thing for anybody to be in the same place with a woman like 
that ” 


93 



I feel quite sure you must be mistaken, Annie , I should be very 
careful how you spiead about a tale of that kind You’d better run along 
back to the Hall, now , I expect they’ll be needing you ” 

So that was what the servants were saying Miss de Vine, of course , 
she was the “ learned lady ” whose arrival had coincided with the 
begmmng of the disturbances — coincided more exactly than Anme could 
know, unless she too had seen that drawing in the quad at the Gaudy A 
cunous woman, Miss de Vine, and undoubtedly with a vaued experience 
behind those disconcerting eyes But Harriet was inclined to like her, and 
she certainly did not look mad in the way that the ‘‘ Poison-Pen ” was 
mad , though it would not be surprising to learn that she had a streak of 
fanaticism somewhere What, by the way, had she been doing the 
previous night ^ She had rooms at the moment in the New Quad , there 
was probably little likelihood of proving an alibi for her now Miss de 
Vine — well ^ she would have to be put on the same footing as everybody 
else 


The Opemng of the Library took place without a hitch The Chan- 
cellor unlocked the mam door with the plated key, unaware that the 
same key had opened it, under cunous circumstances, the mght before 
Hamet watched carefully the faces of the assembled dons and scouts , 
none of them showed any sign of surprise, anger or disappointment at 
the decorous appearance of the Library Miss Hudson was present, 
looking cheerfully unconcerned , Miss Gattermole, too, was there She 
looked as though she had been crying , and Harriet noticed that she 
stood in a corner by herself and talked to nobody until, at the conclusion 
of the ceremony, a dark girl m spectacles made her way through the 
crowd to her and they walked away together 


Later m the day, Harriet went to the Warden to make her promised 
report She pointed out the difficulty of dealing with an outbreak like 
that of the previous mght single-handed A careful patrol of the quads 
and passages by a number of helpers would probably have resulted in 
the capture of the culpnt , and the whole of the suspects could m any 
case have been checked up at an early moment She strongly advised 
enhstmg some women from Miss Ghmpson’s Agency, the nature of which 
she explained 

“ I see the pomt,” replied the Warden , “ but I find that at least two 
members of the Semor Common Room feel very strong objections to that 
course of action ” 

** I know,” said Harriet “ Miss Allison and Miss Barton Why ^ ” 

“ I think, too,” pursued the Warden, without answenng this question, 
that the matter presents certain difficulties What would the students 
94 



dunk of these strangers piowhng about the college at night ^ They will 
wonder why police duties cannot be undertaken by ourselves, and we 
can hardly inform them that we ourselves are particularly under sus- 
picion And to perform such duties as you suggest, properly, qmte a large 
number would be required — if ail the strategic points are to be held 
Then these persons would be quite ignorant of the conditions of college 
life, and might easily make unfortunate mistakes by following and 
questioning the wrong people I do not see how we could avoid a very 
unpleasant scandal and some complaints 
‘‘ I see all that, Warden But all the same, that is the quickest solution 
The Warden bent her head over a handsome piece of tapestry- work 
on which she was engaged 

“ I cannot feel it to be very desirable. I know you will say that the 
whole situation is undesirable I quite agree with you She looked up 
“ I suppose, Miss Vane, you could not yomself spare the time to assist 
us^*» 

“ I could spare the tune,” said Harriet, slowly “ But without help 
It is gomg to be very difficult If there were only one or two people who 
were exonerated without a shadow of doubt it would be very much 
easier ” 

Miss fiarton assisted you very ably last mght ” 

“ Yes,” said Harriet , “ but — how shall I put it ^ If I were writing a 
story about this, the person first on the spot would be the first person to 
be suspected ” 

The Warden selected an orange skein from her basket and threaded 
her needle delibeiately 
“ Will you explain that, please ^ ” 

Harriet explamed carefully 

“ That is very clearly put,” said Dr Baring “ I understand perfectly 
Now, about this student, Miss Hudson Her explanation does not seem 
to be satisfactory She could not possibly ha\e expected to get food from 
the Buttery at that hour , and in fact, she did not ” 

“ No,” said Harriet “ but I know quite well that in my day it wasn*t 
too difficult to get round the right side of the Head Scout to leave the 
hatch open all mght Then, if one had a late essay or anything and felt 
hungry, one went down and got what one wanted ” 

“Dear me,” said the Warden 

“We were always quite honourable about it,” said Harnet, “ and 
entered it ail on the slate, so that it figured m our battels at the end of 
term Though,” she added thoughtfully, “ there were some items of cold 
meat and dnpping that must have been camouflaged a bit Still — I think 
Miss Hudson’s explanation will pass muster ” 

“ A.ctually, the hatch was locked ” 

“ Actually, it was As a matter of fact, I have seen Game, and she 
assures me that it was locked at lo 30 last night as usual She admits that 

95 



Miss Hudson asked her to leave it open, but says she didn’t do so, because, 
only last mght, the Bursar had given special instructions about the locking 
of ie hatch and Buttery That woiiid be after the meeting, no doubt 
She also says she has been more particular this term than she used to be, 
because of a little trouble there was over the same thing last term ” 

«< Well — I see there is no proof against Miss Hudson I believe she is 
rather a lively young woman, however , so it may be as well to keep an 
eye on her She is very able , but her antecedents are not particularly 
refined, and I dare say, it is possible that she might look upon even the 
disagreeable expiessions found m the — er — the communications in the 
light of a joke I tell you this, not to create any prejudice against the girl, 
but merely for whatever evidential value it may possess ” 

“ Thank you Well, then. Warden , if you feel it is impossible to call 
m outside help, I suggest that I should stay in College for a week or so, 
ostensibly to help Miss Lydgate with her book and to do some research 
on my own account m Bodley I could then make a few more investiga- 
tions If nothing decisive results by the end of the term, I really think the 
question of engaging professionals will have to be faced ” 

“ That is a very generous offer,” said the Warden We shall all be 
exceedingly grateful to you ” 

** I ought to warn you,” said Harriet, ** that one or tw^o of the Semor 
Members do not approve of me ” 

” That may make it a little more difficult But if you are ready to put 
up with that unpleasantness m the interests of the College, it can only 
increase our sense of gratitude I cannot too strongly emphasise how 
exceedingly important it is to avoid pubhcity Nothing is more preju- 
dicial to the College in particular and to Umversity women m general 
than spiteful and ill-mformed gossip m the press The students, so far, 
seem to have been very loyal If any of them had been indiscreet we 
should certainly have heard of it by now ” 

** How about Miss Flaxman’s yoxmg man at New College ^ ” 

** Both he and Ivliss Flaxman have behaved quite well At first, 
naturally, it was taken to be a purely personal matter When the situa- 
tion developed, I spoke to Miss Flaxman, and received her assurance 
ihat she and her fiance would keep the whole thing to themselves until 
it could be properly cleared up ” 

” I see,” said Harriet ‘‘ Well, we must do what we can One thing I 
should like to suggest, and that is that some of the passage-lights should 
be left on at mght It is difficult enough to patrol a large set of buildings 
m the light in the dark, it is impossible ” 

That IS reasonable,” replied Dr Baring " I will speak to the Bursar 
about it ” 

And with this unsatisfactory arrangement, Harriet was obliged to be 
content

O my deare CIotis be not sad.

MICHAEL DRAYTON 

It was a matter of mild public mteiest at Shrewsbury College that Miss 
Harriet Vane, the well-known detective novelist, was spending a couple 
of weeks in College, while engaged in research at the Bodleian upon the 
lifeand works of Sheridan Lefanu The excuse was good enough, Harriet 
really was gathering material, in a leisurely way, for a study of Lefanu, 
though the Bodleian was not, perhaps, the ideal source for it But there 
must be some reason given for her presence, and Oxford is willmg enough 
to believe that the Bodleian is the hub of the scholar’s universe She was 
able to find enough references among the Periodical Publications to 
justify an optimistic answer to kindly inquiries about her progress , and 
if, in fact, she snoozed a good deal in the arms of Duke Humphrey by 
day, to make up for those hours of the mght spent m snooping about the 
corridors, she was probably not the only person in Oxford to find the 
atmosphere of old leather and central heating favourable to slumber 
At the same time, she devoted a good many hours to establishing order 
among Miss Lydgate’s chaotic proofs The Introduction was rewritten, 
and the obliterated passages restored, from the author’s capacious 
memory , the disfigured pages were replaced from fresh proof-sheets , 
fifty-mne errors and obscurities in the 'cross-references were eliminated , 
the rejoinder to Mr Elkbottom was incorporated m the text and made 
more vigorous and conclusive , and the authorities at the Press began to 
speak quite hopefully about the date of pubhcation 
Whether because Hamet’s mght prowhngs, or perhaps the mere 
knowledge that the circle of suspects was so greatly narrowed, had 
intimidated the Poison-Pen, or for some other reason, there were few 
outbreaks during the next few days One tiresome episode was the 
complete stoppmg-up of the lavatory basin dram in the SCR cloak- 
room. This was found to be due to some tom fragments of materia^ 
which had been rammed firmly down through the grid with the help of 
a fine rod, and which, when the plumber had got them out, proved to 

97 



be the remains of a pair of fabric gloves, stained with brown paint and 
quite unidentifiable as anybody’s property Another was the noisy 
emeigence of the missing Library keys from the interior of a roll of 
photographs which Miss Pyke had left for half an hour in one of the 
lecture-rooms before using them to illustrate some remarks about the 
Parthenon Frieze Neither of these episodes led to any discovery 

The Semor Common Room behaved to Haniet with that scrupulous 
and impel sonal lespect for a person’s xmssion m life which the scholarly 
tradition imposes It was clear to them that, once established as the 
ofiSciai imestigatoi, she must be allowed to investigate without inter- 
ference Nor did they hasten to her with protestations of innocence or 
cries of indignation They treated the situation with a fine detachment, 
making little refeience to it, and confining the convex sation in Common 
Room to matters of general and University interest In solemn and 
ritual order, they imated her to consume sherry or coffee m their rooms, 
and refrained from comment upon one another Miss Barton, indeed, 
went out of her way to mvite Harriet’s opinions upon JVomen tn the 
Modern State and to consult hei on the subject of conditions in Germany 
It is true that she flatly disagreed with many of the opinions expressed, 
but only objectively and without peisonal rancour , the vexed subject 
of the amateur’s right to imestigate crimes was decently shelved l^s 
Hillyard also, setting aside animosity, took pains to interrogate Harnct 
about the techmcal aspect of such historical crimes as the murder of Sir 
Edmund Berry Godfrey and the alleged poisoning of Sir Thomas Over- 
bury by the Countess of Essex Such overtures might, of course, be 
policy , but Harriet was inclined to attribute them to a careful instinct 
for propriety 

With Miss de Vine she had manv interesting conversations The 
Fellow’s peisonahty attracted and puzzled hei very much Moxe than 
with any other of the dons, she felt that with Miss de Vine the devotion 
to die intellectual life was the result, not of the untroubled following of 
a natural or acquired bias, but of a powerful spiritual call, over-nding 
other possible tendencies and desires She felt inquisitive enough, 
without any prompting, about Miss de Vine’s past life , but inquiry was 
difficult, and she always emerged from an encountei with the feeling 
that she had told more than she had learnt She could guess at a history 
of conflict , but she found it difficult to beheve that Miss de Vine was 
unaware of her own repressions or unable to control them 

With a view to establishmg friendly relations with the Jumor Common 
Room, Harriet further steeled herself to compose and deliver a “ talk ” 
on “ Detection m Fact and Fiction ” foi a College literary society This 
was perilous work To the unfortunate case in which she had herself 
figured as the suspected party she naturally made no allusion , nor in the 
ensuing discussion was anybody so tactless as to mention it The Wiiver- 
combe murder was a different matter There was no obvious reason why 

98 



she should not tell the students about that, and it seemed unkind to 
deprive them of a legitimate thrill on the purely personal groimds that 
it was a bore to have to mention Peter Wimsey in every second sentence. 
Her exposition, though perhaps erring slightly on the dry and academic 
side, was received with hearty applause, and at the end of the meeting 
the Senxor Student, one Miss Miilbanks, invited her to cofTet 
Miss Miilbanks had her room in Queen Elizabeth, and had furnished 
it with a good deal of taste She was a tall, elegant girl, obviously well-to- 
do, much better dressed than the majority of the students, and carrying 
her intellectual attainments easily She held a nunor scholarship without 
emoluments, declaring publicly that she was a scholar only because she 
would not be seen dead in the ridiculous short gowm of a commoner As 
alternatives to coffee, she offered Harriet the cnoice of madeira or a 
cocktail, politely regrettmg that the inadequacy of college arrangements 
made it impossible to pro\’ide ice for the shaker Harriet, who disliked 
cocktails after dinner, and had consumed madeira and sherry on an 
almost wearisome number of occasions since her arrival in Oxford, 
accepted the coffee, and chuckled as cups and glasses were filled Miss 
Miilbanks inquired courteously what the joke was 
“ Only,” said Harriet, that I gathered the other day from an 
article m the Morning Star that ‘ undergraduettes,’ in the journalist’s 
disgustmg phrase, lived entirely on cocoa ” 

Journalists,” said Miss Miilbanks, condescendingly, “ are always 
thirty years behmd the times Have you ever seen cocoa m College, Miss 
Fowler ? ” 

” Oh, yes,” said Miss Fowler She was a dark, thick-set Third Year, 
dressed in a very grubby sw^^eater which, as she had previously explained, 
she had not had time to change, havmg been afflicted with an essay up 
to the moment of attending Harriet’s talk “ Yes, I’ve seen it m dons’ 
rooms Occasionally But I’ve always looked on that as a kind of 
infantilism ” 

” Isn’t it a re-hvmg of the heroic past ^ ” suggested Miss Miilbanks. 
” 0 Us beaux jours que ce stick de fer And so on ” 

” Groupists dnnk cocoa,” added another Third Year She was thin, 
with an eager, scornful face, and made no apology for her sweater, 
apparently thinking such matters beneath her notice 
** But they are oh ^ so tender to the failings of others,” said Miss Mill- 
banks Miss Layton was ‘ changed * once, but she has now changed 
back It was good while it lasted ” 

Miss Layton, curled on a pouffe by the fire, lifted a wicked little 
heart-shaped face alight with mischief 
” I did enjoy telling people what I thought of them Too rapturous 
Especially confessing m pubhc the evil, evil tlioughts I had had about 
that woman Flaxman ” 

” Bother Flaxman,” said the dark girl, shortly Her name was 

99 



Haydock, and she was, as Harriet presently discovered, considered to be 
a safe History First “ Slie*s setting tlie whole Second Year by the ears 
I don’t like her influence at all And if vou ask me, there’s something 
very wrong with Gattermole Goodness knows, I don’t want anv of this 
business of being my brother’s keeper — we had quite enough of that at 
school — but itli be awkward if Gattermole is driven into doing some- 
thing drastic As Senior Student, Lilian, don’t you tmnk you coaid do 
something about it ^ ” 

“ My dear,” protested Miss Millbanks, what can anybody do ^ I 
can’t forbid Fiaxman to make people’s lives a buiden to them If 1 could, 

I wouldn’t You don’t suiely expect me to exercise authority ^ It’s bad 
enough hounding people to College Meetings The S G R don’t 
understand our sad lack of enthusiasm ” 

In their day,” said Harnet, “ I think people had a passion for 
meetings and organisation ” 

“ There are plenty of inter-collegiate meetings,” said ISAiss Layton 
“ We discuss things a great deal, and are indignant about the Proctorial 
Rules for Mixed Parties But our enthusiasm for inieinai aflaiib ’s more 
restrained ” 

” Well, I think,” said Miss Haydock bluntly, “ we sometimes overdo 
the laisser-aller side of it If there’s a big blow-up, it won’t pay anybody ” 
” Do you mean about Flaxman’s cutting-out expeditions Or about 
the ragging affair By the way, Miss Vane, I suppose you have heard 
about the College Mystery ” 

“ I’ve heard something,” replied Harriet, cautiously “ It seems to be 
all very tiresome ” 

** It will be extremely tiresome if it isn’t stopped,” said Miss Havdock 
” I say we ought to do a spot of pnvate investigation ourselves The 
SCR don’t seem to be making much progress ” 

” Well, the last effort at investigation wasn’t very satisfactory,” said 
Miss Millbanks 

Meaning Gattermole ^ I don’t believe it’s Gattermole She’s too 
obvious And she hasn’t the guts She could and does make an ass of 
herself, but she wouldn’t go about it so secretively ” 

“ There’s nothing against Gattermole,” said Miss Fowler, “ except 
that somebody wrote Fiaxman an offensive letter on the occasion of her 
swiping Gattermole’s young man Gattermole was the obvious suspect 
then, but why should she do all these other things ^ ” 

” Surely,” Miss Layton appealed to Harriet, ” surely the obvious 
suspect is always innocent ” 

Harriet laughed , and Miss Millbanks said 

” Yes , but I do think Gattermole is getting to the stage when she’d 
do almost anvthing to attract attention ” 

“Well, I don’t believe it’s Gattermole,” said Miss Haydock “ Why 
should she write letters to ” 
lOO 



Did you have one ^ ” 

“ Yes , but It was onH a kind of wsh that I should plough in Schools- 
The usual silly thing made of pasted-up letters I burnt it, and took 
Gattermoic m to dinner on the stiengtii of it” 

** Good for you,” said Miss Fowler 

“ I had one too,” said Miss Lavton “ A beauty —about there being a 
reward m hell for women who went mv wav So, acting on the suggestion 
given, I forwarded it to my future addiess by way of the fireplace ” 

” All the same ” said Miss Miilbanks, “ it is rather disgusting I don*t 
mind the letters so much It’s the rags, and the writing on the wall If any 
snoopy person from outside happened to get hold of it, there’d be a public 
stink, and that would be a bore I don’t pretend to much public spirit, 
but I admit to some We don’t want to get the whole College gated by 
way of reprisals And I’d lather not have it said that we were living in a 
madhouse ” 

** Too shame-making,” agreed Miss Layton , “ though of couise, you 
may get an isolated queer specimen anywhere ” 

“ There are some oddities in the First Year all right,” said Miss Fowler 
Why IS it that every year seems to get shriller and scrubbier than the 
last ^ ” 

“ They always did,” said Haniet 

“ Yes,” said Miss Haydock, ** I expect the Thud Year said the same 
about us when we first came up But it’s a fact that we had none of this 
trouble before we had this bunch of freshers in ” 

Harriet did not contradict this, not wishing to focus suspicion on 
either the SCR or on the unfortunate Cattermole who (as everybody 
would remember) was up during the Gaudy, waging simultaneous war 
against despised love and Responsions She did ask, however, whether 
any suspicion had fallen upon other students besides Miss Cattermole 
** Not definitely, no,” replied Miss Miilbanks ** There’s Hudson, of 
course — ^she came up from school with a bit of a reputation for ragging, 
but in my opinion she’s qmte sound I should call the whole of our year 
prettjr sound And Cattermole really has only herself to thank I mean, 
she’s asking for trouble ” 

“ How ^ ” asked Harriet 

“ Various ways,” said Miss Miilbanks, with a caution which suggested 
that Harriet was too much in the confidence of the SCR to be trusted 
with details She is rather mdmed to break rules for the sake of it — 
which IS all right if you get a kick out of it , but she doesn’t ” 

“ Cattermole’s going m off the deep end,” said Miss Haydock “ Wants 
to show young what’s-his-name — Farnngdon — ^he isn’t the only pebble 
on the beach All very well But she’s being a bit blatant She’s simply 
pursuing that lad Pomfret ” 

“ That fair-faced goop at Qjieen’s ^ ” said Miss Fowler Well, she’s 
going to be unlucky again, because Fiaxman is steadily harding him off ” 

xoi 



** Gurse Flaxman ’ said Miss Haydock Can’t she leave other 
people’s men alone ^ She’s bagged Farnngdon , I do think she might 
leave Pomfret for Gattermole ” 

She hates to leave anybody anything,” said Miss Layton 
“ I hope,” said Miss Millbanks, she has not been trying to collect 
your Geoffrey ” 

Fm not giving her the opportumtv,” said Miss Layton, with an 
impish grin Geoflfrey’s sound — yes, darlings, defimteiy sound — but 
I’m taking no chances Last time we had him to tea in the J G R , 
Flaxman came undulating in— -ro sorry, she had no idea anybody was 
there, and she’d left a book behind With the Engaged Label on the door 
as large as life I did not introduce Geoffrey ” 

Did he want you to ^ ” mqiured Miss Haydock 
** Asked who she was I said she was the Templeton Scholar and the 
world’s heavyweight in the way of learmng That put him off ” 

** What’ll Geoffrey do when you pull off your Fust, my clnld ^ ” 
demanded Miss Haydock 

Well, Eve — it will be awkward if I do that Poor lamb ^ I shall have 
to make him believe I only did it by looking fragile and pathetic at the 
viva ” 

And I^iiss Layton did, indeed, contrive to look fragile and pathetic, 
and anything but learned Nevertheless, on inquiry from Miss Lydgate, 
Harriet discovered that she was an exceptionally well-fancied favourite 
for the English School, and was taking, of all things, a Language Special 
If the dry bones of Philology could be made to live by Miss Layton, then 
she was a very dark horse indeed Harnet felt a respect for her brains , 
so unexpected a personality might be capable of anything 
* # • • # 

So much for Third-Year opimon Harriet’s first personal encounter 
with the Second Year was more dramatic 

The College had been so qmet for the last week that Harnet gave 
herself a holiday from pohee-duty and went to a private dance given 
by a contemporary of her own, who had married and settled m North 
Oxford Retummg between twelve and one, she garaged the car in the 
Dean’s private garage, let herself quietly through the grille dividing the 
Traffic Entrance from the rest of College and began to cross the Old 
Qpad towards Tudor The weather had turned finer, and there w^as a 
pale glimmer of cloudy moonlight Against that glimmer, Harnet, 
skirting the corner of Burleigh Building, observed something humped and 
strange about the outline of the eastern wall, close to where the Princi- 
pal’s private postern led out mto St Gross Road It seemed clear that 
here, in the words of the old song, was “ a man where nae man should 
be ” 

102 



If she shouted at him, he would drop over on the outer side and be 
lost She had the kev of the postern wth her — shaving been trusted with 
a complete set of keys for patrol purposes Puihng her black evening 
cloak about her face and stepping softlv, Harriet ran quickl'jr down the 
grass path between the W'arden’s House and the Fellows’ Garden, let 
herself silently out into St Cross Road and stood beneath tiie wall As 
she emerged, a second dark form stepped out from the shadov^s and said 
urgently, ‘‘ ” 

The gentleman on the wall looked round, exclaimed, “ Oh, hell * ” 
and scrambled down in a hurry His friend made off at a smart pace, but 
the wall-climber seemed to have damaged himself in his descent, and 
made but poor speed Harnet, wdio was mmble enough, for all she was 
over mne yeais down from Oxford, gave chase and came up with him a 
few yards fiom the corner of Jowett Walk The accomplice, now well 
away, looked back, hesitating 

“ Clear out, old boy * ” yelled the capture , and then, turmng to 
Harnet, remarked with a sheepish gnn, “ Well, it’s a fair cop I’ve bust 
my ankle or something ” 

“ And what were you doing on our w^all, sir ^ ” demanded Harnet 
In the moonlight she beheld a fresh, fair and ingenuous face, youthfuDy 
rounded and, at the moment, disturbed by an expression of mangled 
apprehension and amusement He was a very tall and very large young 
man , but Harnet had clasped him in a wiry gnp that he could scarcely 
shake ofT without hurting her, and he showed no disposition to use 
violence 

“ Just having a beano,” said the young man, promptly A bet, you 
know, and all that Hang my cap on the tip-top branch of the Shrewsbury 
beeches My friend there was the witness I seem to have lost, don’t I ^ ” 

‘‘ In that case,” said Harnet, severely, “ where’s your cap ^ And your 
gown, if It comes to that ^ And, sir, your rame and college ^ ” 

“ Well,” said the young man, impudently, “ if it comes to that, where 
and what are yours ^ ” 

When one’s thirty-second birthday is no more than a matter of months 
away, such a question is flatteimg Hainet laughed 

“ My dear yoimg man, do you take me for an undergraduate ^ ” 

** A don — a female don, God help us ’ ” exclaimed tlie young man, 
whose spirits appeared to be sustained, though not unduly exalted, by 
spirituous liquors 

“ Well ? ” said Harriet 

“ I don’t believe it,” said the young man, scanmng her face as closely 
as he could m the feeble light “ Not possible Too young Too charming 
Too much sense of humour ” 

“ A great deal too much sense of humour to let you get away with that, 
my lad And no sense of humour at all about this intrusion ” 

** I say,” said the young man, “ I’m really most fnghtfuUy sorry Mere 

103 



light-heartedness and all that kind of thing Honestly, we weren’t doing 
any harm Quite definitely not I mean, wc were just winmng the bet 
and going away quietly I say, do be a sport I mean, you’re not the 
Warden or the Dean or anything I know them Couldn’t you overlook 
it^” 

“ It’s all very well,” said Harnet But we can’t have this kind of 
thing It doesn’t do You must see that it doesn’t do ” 

** Oh, I do see,” agreed the young man Absolutely Definitely 
Dashed silly thmg to do Open to misinterpretation ” He winced, and 
drew up one leg to rub his injured ankle “ But when you do see a 
tempting bit of wall like that ” 

All, yes,” said Harnet, “ what ts the temptation ^ Just come and 
show me, will you ^ ” She led him firmly, despite his protests, towards the 
postern “ Oh, I see, yes A brick or two out of that buttress Excellent 
foothold You’d almost think they’d been knocked out on purpose, 
wouldn’t you ^ And a handy tree m the Fellows’ Garden The Bursar 
will have to see to it Are you well acquainted with that buttress, young 
man ^ ” 

It’s known to exist,” admitted her captive “ But, look here, we 
weren’t — ^we weren’t calling on anybody or anything of that kind, you 
know, if you know what I mean ” 

“ I hope not,” said Harnet 

** No, we were all on our own,” explained the yoimg man, eagerly 
“ Nobody else involved Good Heavens, no And, look here, I’ve bust 

my ankle and we shall be gated anyhow, and, dear, kind lady ” 

At this moment, a loud groan resounded from within the College wall 
The young man’s face became filled with agomsed alarm 
“ What’s that ^ ” asked Harnet 
“ I really couldn’t say,” said the young man 

The groan was repeated Harnet grasped the undergraduate tightly 
by the arm and led him along to the postern 
** But look here,” said the gentleman, limping dolefully beside her, 

“ you mustn’t — ^pleasc don’t think ” 

** I’m gomg to see what’s the matter,” said Harnet 
She unlocked the postern, drew her captive in with her, and relocked 
the gate Under the wall, just beneath the spot where the young man 
had been perched, lay a huddled figure, which was apparently sufFenng 
acute internal agonies of some kind, 

‘‘ Look here,” said the young man, abandoning all pretence “ I’m 
most frightfully sorry about this I’m afraid we were a bit thoughtless I 
mean, we didn’t notice I mean, I’m afraid she isn’t very well, and we 
didn’t notice how it was, you know ” 

“ The girl’s drunk,” said Harnet, uncompromisingly 
She had, m the bad old days, seen too many young poets similarly 
afflicted to make any mistake about the symptoms 
104 



Well, Fm afraid — yes^ that’s about said the young man Rogers 
mil mix ’em so strong But look here, honestly, there’s no harm done, and 
I mean 

“ H’m * ” said Haruet Well, don’t shout That house is the Warden’s 
Lodgings ” 

“ Hell * ” said the young man, for the second time “ I say — are you 
going to be sporting ^ ” 

“ That depends,” said Harriet “ As a matter of fact, you’ve been 
extraordinarily lucky I’m not one of the dons Fm only staying in 
College So I’m a free agent ” 

“ Bless you * ” exclaimed the young man, fervently 
‘‘ Don’t be in a hurry You’ll have to tell me about this Who’s the 
girl, by the way ^ ” 

The patient here gave another groan 
“ Oh, dear * ” said the undergraduate 

** Don’t worry,” said Harriet She’ll be sick in a minute ” She walked 
over and inspected the sufferer “It’s all right You can preserve a 
gendemanly reticence I know her Her name’s Catteimole What’s 
yours ^ ” 

“ My name’s Pomfret — of Queen’s ” 

“ Ah • ” said Harriet 

“ We threw a party round in my friend’s looms,” explained Mr 
Pomfret “ At least, it started as a meeting, but it ended as a paity 
Nothing wrong whatever Miss Cattermole came along for a joke All 
clean fun Only there were a lot of us, and what witii one tmng and 
another we had a few too many, and then we found Miss Cattermole was 
rather under the weather So we got her collected up, and Rogers and 
I ” 

“ Yes, I see,” said Harriet “ Not very creditable, was it ^ ” 

“ No, It’s rotten,” admitted Mr Pomfret 
“ Had sh^ got leave to attend the meeting ^ And late leave ^ ” 

“ I don’t know,” said JMr Pomfret, disturbed “ Fm afraid — ^look 
here * It’s all rather tiresome I mean, she doesn’t belong to the 

Society ” 

“ What Society ^ ” 

“ The Society that was meeting I think she pushed m for a joke ” 
Gate-crashed you ^ H’m That probably means no late leave ” 
Sounds serious,” said Mr Pomfret 

** It’s serious for said Harnet. “ You’ll get off with a fine or a 
gating, I suppose , but we have to be more particular It’s a nasty- 
minded world, and our rules have to remember that fact ” 

“ I know,” said Mr Pomfret “ As a matter of fact we were dashed 
worried, Wc had a devil of a job getting her along,” he burst out con- 
fidentially. “ Fortunately it was only from this end of Long Wall 
Phew » ” 

4 * 105 



He pTilled out his handkerchief and wiped his forehead 
“ Anyhow,” he went on, “ I*in thankful you aren’t a don ” 

“ That’s all very well,” said Harriet austerely , “ but I’m a Senior 
Member of College and I must feel responsibility This isn’t the kind of 
thing one wants ” 

She turned a cold glance on the unfoitunate Miss Cattermole, to whom 
the worst was happemng 

** I’m sure we didn’t want it,” said Mr Pomfret, averting his eyes , 
“ but what could we do ^ It’s no good tiynng to corrupt your porter,” 
he added mgenuously , “ it’s been tried ” 

“ Indeed ^ ” said Harriet No , you wouldn’t get much change out 
of Padgett Was anybody else there from Shrewsbury ^ ” 

“ Yes — ^Miss Flaxman and Miss Blake But they had ordinary leave to 
come and went off at about eleven So they’re all right ” 

“ They ought to have taken Miss Cattermole with them ” 

“ Of course,” said Mr Pomfret He looked gloomier than ever 
Obviously, thought Harnct, Miss Flaxman would not mind at all if Miss 
Cattermole got into trouble Miss Blake’s motives were more obscure , 
but she was probably only weak-nunded Harriet was fired wnth a quite 
unscrupulous determination that Miss Cattermole should not get into 
trouble if she could prevent it She went across to the limp form and 
hauled it to its feet Miss Cattermole groaned dismally “ She’ll do now,” 
said Harnet “ I wonder where the little fool’s room is Do you kno'^v ^ ” 
** Well, as a matter of fact, I do,” replied Mr Pomfret Sounds bad, 
but there — ^people do show people their rooms, you know, all regulations 
notwithstanding and all that It’s somewhere over there, through that 
archway ” 

He waved a vague hand towards the New Quad at the other end of 
nowhere 

Heavens * ” said Harnet, ** it w^ould be I’m afraid you’ll have to 
give me a hand wiih her She’s a bit too much for me, and she can’t stay 
here in the damp If anybody sees us, you’ll have to go through with it 
How’s the ankle ? ” 

“ Better, thanks,” said Mr Pomfret “ I think I can make shift to 
stagger a bit I say, you’re being very decent ” 

“ Get on with the job,’^ said Harriet, grimly, and don’t waste time 
on speeches ” 

Miss Cattermole was a thickly-built young woman, and no incon- 
siderable weight She had also reached the stage of complete inertia 
For Harnet, hampered by high-heeled shoes, and for Mr Pomfret, 
afflicted with a game ankle, the progress across the quads was anything 
but triumphal It was also rather noisy, what with the squeak of stone 
and gravel under their feet, and tlie giunts and shufflmgs of the limp 
figure between them At every moment, Harriet expected to hear a 
wmdow thrust up, or to see the shape of an agitated don come rushing out 
io6 



to demand some explanation of Mr Pomfrct’s presence at that early 
hour of the morning It was with very great relief that she at last found 
the right doorway and propelled Miss Gattermole’s helpless form through 
It 

“ What next ^ inquired Mr Pomfret m a hoarse whisper 
“ I must let you out I don^t know where her room is, but I can’t have 
you wandering all over College Wait a minute We’ll deposit her in the 
nearest bathroom Here you are Round the corner Easy does it ” 

Mr Pomfret again bent obligingly to the task 

“ There * ” said Harriet She laid Miss Gattermole on her back on the 
bathroom floor, took the key from the lock and came out, secunng the 
door behind her “ She must stay there for the moment Now we’ll get 
rid of you I don’t think anybody saw us If we’ie met on the way back, 
you were at Mrs Hemans’ dance and saw me home Get that ^ It’s not 
very convmcmg, because you ought not to have done any such thmg, 
but It’s bettei than the truth ” 

** I only wish I had been at Mrs Hemans’ dance,” said the grateful 
Mr Pomfret “I’d have danced every dance with you and all the extras 
Do you mind telling me who you are ^ ” 

“ My name’s Vane And you’d better not start bemg enthusiastic too 
soon I’m not considering your welfare particularly Do you know Miss 
Gattermole well ^ ” 

“ Rather well Oh, yes Naturally I mean, we know some of the same 
people and that sort of thmg As a matter of fact, she used to be engaged 
to an old schoolfellow of mine — ^New College man — only that fell through 
and all that No affair of mine , but you know how it is One knows 
people and one kind of goes on knowing them And there you are ” 

“ Yes, I see Well, Mr Pomfret, I am not anxious to get either you or 

Miss Gattermole into a row ” 

“ I knew you were a sport * ” cried Mr Pomfret 
“ (Don’t shoid) — ^but this sort of thmg cannot go on There must be no 
more late parties and no more chmbmg over walls You understand Not 
with anybody It’s not fair If I go to the Dean with this story, nothing 
much happen to you^ but Miss Gattermole will be lucky if she’s not 
sent down For God’s sake, stop bemg an ass There are much better ways 
of enjoying Oxford than fooling round at midmght with tlie women 
students ” 

“ I know there are I think it’s all rather rot, really ” 

“ Then why do it ^ ” 

“ I don’t know Why does one do idiotic thmgs ^ ” 

“ Why ^ ” said Harnet They were passing the end of the Chapel, and 
Harriet stood still to give emphasis to what she was saying “ I’ll tell you 
why, Mr Pomfret Because you haven’t the guts to say No when some- 
body asks you to be a sport That tom-fool word has got more people m 
trouble than all the rest of the dictionary put together If it’s sporting to 

107 



encourage guls to break rules and drink more tlian they can carry and 
get themselves into a mess on your account, then Fd stop bemg a sport 
and try bemg a gentleman ” 

** Oh, I say,** said Mr Poinfiet, hurt 
“ I mean it/* said Haniet 

Well, I see your point/* said Mr Pomfret, shifting his feet uneasily 
“ 1*11 do my best about it You’ve been dashed s.por — I mean you’ve 

behaved like a perfect gentleman about all this ” he grinned— 

“ and I’ll try to — ^good Lord * here’s somebody coming ” 

A quick patter of slippered feet along the passage between the Hall 
and ^ueen Ehzabeth was approaching rapidly 
On an impulse, Harriet stepped back and pushed open the Chapel 
door 

Get in/’ she said 

Mr Pomfret slipped hastily m behind her Harriet shut the door on 
him and stood quietly in front of it The footsteps came nearer, came 
opposite the porch and stopped suddenly The mght-walker uttered a 
iitde squeak* 

« Ooh » ” 

“ What IS it ^ ” said Harriet 

“Oh, miss, it’s you • You gave me such a start Did you sec anything ?** 
“ See what ^ Who is it, by the way ? ” 

“ Emily, miss I sleep m the New Quad, miss, and I woke up, and I 
made sure I heard a man’s voice in the quadrangle, and I looked out and 
there he was, miss, as plain as plain, coming this way with one of the 
young ladies So I slipped on my slippers, miss . ” 

“ Damn * ” said Harriet to herself Better tell part of the truth, though 
“ It’s all right, Emily It was a friend of mine He came in with me and 
wanted very much to see the New Quad by moonlight So we just walked 
across and back again ” 

(A poor excuse, but probably less suspicious than a flat demal ) 

“ Oh, I see, miss I beg your pardon But I get that nervous, with one 
thmg and another And it’s unusual, if you’ll excuse me saying so, 

tmg.g •* 

“ Yes, very,” said Harnet, strolhng gently away m the direction of the 
New Quad, so that the scout was bound to follow her “ It was stupid of 
me not to think that it might disturb people I’ll mention it to the Dean 
m the mormng You did quite right to come down ” 

“ Well, miss, of course I didn’t know who it was And the Dean is so 
particular And with all these queer things happemng ” 

“ Yes, absolutely Of course I’m leally very sorry to have been so 
thoughtless The gentleman has gone now, so you won’t get woken up 
agam ” 

Emily seemed doubtful She was one of those people who never feel 
they have said a thmg till they have said it three times over She paused 
108 



at the foot of her staircase to sa^ everything again Harriet listened 
impatiently, thinking of Mr Pomfret, fuming in the Chapel At last she 
got nd of the scout and turned back 

Complicated, thought Hairiet , silly situation, like a farce Emily 
thinks she’s caught a student I think I’ve caught a Poltergeist We 
catch each other Young Pomfret pa^-ked m the Chapel Ke thinks I’m 
kindly shielding him and Cattermole Having carefiiil> hidden Pomfret, 
I have to admit he was there But if Emily had been the Poltergeist — and 
perhaps she is — then I couldn’t have had Pomfret helping to chase her 
This kind of sleuthing is very confusion-making 

She pushed open the Chapel door The porch was empty 

“ Damn * ” said Harriet, irreverently “ The idiot’s gone Perhaps he’s 
gone inside, though ” 

She looked in through the inner dooi ana was relieved to sec a dark 
figure faintly outhned against the pale oak of the stalls Then, with a 
sudden, violent shock, she became aware of a second dark figure, poised 
strangely, it seemed, m mid-air 

“ Hullo ’ ” said Harriet In the thin light of the South windows she 
saw the flash of a white shirt-front as Mr Pomfret turned “ It’s only 
me Whaesikat^^^ 

She took a torch from her handbag and recklessly switched it on The 
beam showed a dismal shape dangling from the canopy above the stalls 
It was swinging a little to and fro and turmng slowly as it swung Harriet 
darted forward 

“ Morbid kind of imagination these girh have got, haven’t they ^ ” 
said Mr Pomfret 

Harriet contemplated the M A cap and gown, arranged over a dress 
and bolster hitched by a thin cord to one of the terminals with which the 
architect had decorated the canopies 

“ Bread-kmfe stuck through the tummy, too,” pursued Mr Pomfret 
“ Gave me quite a turn, as my aunt would say Did you catch the young 
woman ^ ” 

** No Was she m here ^ ” 

Oh, defimteiy,” said Mr Pomfret Thought I’d retreat a bit 
farther, you know. So in I came Then I saw that So I came along to 
investigate and heard somebody sciambhng out by the other door — over 
there ” 

He pointed vaguely towards the north side of the building, where a 
door led into the vestry Harriet hastened to look The door was open, and 
the outer vestry door, though shut, had been unlocked from within She 
peered out All was quiet 

Bother them and their rags,” said Harriet, returmng “ No, I didn’t 
meet the lady She must have got away while I was taking Emily back to 
the New Qjaad Just my luck * ” She muttered the last exclamation under 
her breath It was really sickemng to have had the Poltergeist under her 

10 ® 



hand like that, and to have been distracted by Emily* She went up to 
the dummy again, and saw that a paper was pinned to its middle by the 
bread-knife. * 

“ Quotation from the classics,” said Mr Pomfret, easily ** Looks as 
though somebody had a grouse against your dons ” 

** Silly young fools * ” said Harriet ‘‘ Very convincing bit of work, 
though, come to look at it If we hadn’t found it first, it would have 
created quite a sensation when we all filed into prayers A little investi- 
gation IS indicated Well, now, it’s time you went quietly home and were 
gated for the good of your soul ” 

She led him down to the postern and let him out 

“ By the way, Mr Pomfret, I’d be obliged if you didn’t mention this 
rag to anybody. It’s not in the best of taste One good turn deserves 
another ” 

“Just as you say,” replied Mr Pomfret “ And, look here — may I 
push round to-moirow — at least, it’s this mormng, isn’t it ^ — and make 
inquiries and all that ^ Only proper, you know When shall you be in ^ 
Please * ” 

“ No visitors in the mormng,” said Harriet, promptly “ I don’t know 
what I shall be domg m the afternoon But you can always ask at the 
Lodge ” 

“ Oh, I may ^ That’s top-hole I’ll call — and if you’re not there I’ll 
leave a note I mean, you must come round and have tea or a cocktail 
or something And I do honestly pronoise it shan’t happen again, if I can 
help It ” 

“ AU nght By the way — ^what time did Miss Cattermole arrive at your 
fnend’s place ^ ” 

“ Oh — about half-past mne, I think Couldn’t be sure Why ^ ” 

“ I only wondered whether her initials were in the porter’s book But 
I’ll see to it Good-mght ” 

“ Good-mght,” said Mr Pomfret, “ and thanks frightfully ” 


Harriet locked the postern behind him and returned across the quad- 
rangle, feclmg that, out of all this absurd tiiesomeness, something had 
been most definitely gamed The dummy could scarcely have been put 
m position before 9 30 , so that Miss Cattermole, through sheer folly, had 
contnved to give herself a cast-iron alibi Harriet was so grateful to her 
for advancing the inquiry by even this small step that she determined the 
girl should, if possible, be let off the consequences of her escapade 
This renainded her that Miss Cattermole still lay on the bathroom 
fioor, waitmg to be dealt with It would be awkward if she had come to 
her senses m the mterval and started to make a noise But on reaching 
the New Qpad and unlocking the door, Hainet found her prisoner in the 
somnolent stage of her rake’s progress A little research along the 
1x0 



corridors levealed that Miss Cattermole slept on the first floor Harriet 
opened^ the door of the room, and as she did^o th^ door next it opened 
also, and a head popped out 

Is that you, Cattermole ^ ” whispered the head “ Oh, Fm sorry ” 
It popped in again 

Harriet recognised the girl who had gone up and spoken to Miss 
Cattermole after the Optmng of the Libraiy She went to her door, winch 
bore the name of ‘ G I Briggs,” and knocked gently The head 
reappeared 

“ Were you expecting to see Miss Cattermole come m ^ ” 

“ Well,” said Miss Briggs, “ I heaid somebody at her door — oh* it*s 
Miss Vane, isn’t it ^ ” 

“ Yes What made you sit up and wait for Kliss Cattermole ^ ” 

Miss Briggs, who was weanng a woolly coat o\er her pyjamas, looked 
a little alarmed 

‘‘ I had some work to do I was sitting up m any case Why ^ ” 

Harriet looked at the girl She was short and sturdily built, with a 
plain, strong, sensible face She appeared trustworthy 
“ If you’re a friend of Miss Gattermole’s,” said Harriet, “ you’d 
better come and help me upstairs with her She’s dowm m the bathroom 
I found her being helped over the wall by a )oung man, and she’s rather 
under the weather ” 

“ Oh, dear * ” said Miss Briggs Tight ^ ” 

“ I’m afraid so ” 

“ She %s a fool,” said Miss Briggs “ I knew thcre’d be trouble some 
day* All right, I’ll come ” 

Between them they lugged Miss Cattermole up the noisy, polished 
stairs and dumped her upon her bed In gnm silence they undressed 
her and put her between the sheets 

She’ll sleep it off now,” said Hamet “ I think, by the way a little 
explanation wouldn’t be a bad idea How about it ^ ” 

“ Gome into my room,” said Miss Bnggs “ Would you like any hot 
milk or Ovaltme or coffee, or anything ^ ” 

Harriet accepted hot milk Miss Bnggs put a kettle on t!ie ring in the 
pantry opposite, came m, stirred up the fire and sat down on a pouffe 
“ Please tell me,” said Miss Briggs, “ what has happened ” 

Harriet told her, omitting the name*' of the gentlemen concerned But 
Miss Bnggs promptly supphed the omission 
“ That was Reggie Pomfret, of course,” she observed “ Poor blighter 
He always gets left with the baby After all, what is the lad to do, if people 
go chasing him ^ ” 

” It’s awkward,” said Hainet ” I mean, >ou need some knowledge of 
the world to get out of it gracefully Does the girl really care for 
him ^ ” 

“ No,” said Miss Briggs Not really She just wants somebody or 

IXI 



something You know She got a na<5ty knock when her engagement was 
broken You see, she and Lionel Farnngdon had been childhood fnends 
and so on, and it was ail settled befoie she came up Then Farnngdon 
got collared by our Miss Flaxman, and tliere was a frightful bust-up 
And there were complications And Violet Cattermole has gone all 
unnerved ” 

“ I know,®’ said Harriet “ Sort of desperate feeling — I must have a 
man of my own— that bnd of thing ” 

** Yes Doesn’t matter who he is I think it’s a sort of inferiority com- 
plex, or something One must do idiotic things and assert one’s self Am 
I mabng myself clear ^ ” 

** Oh, yes I understand that perfectly It happens so often One just 
has to make one’s self out no end of a little devil Has this kind of 
thing happened often ^ ” 

** Well,” confessed Miss Briggs, “ more often than I like I’ve tried to 
keep Violet reasonable, but what’s the good of preaching to people ^ 
When they get into that worked-up state you might as well talk to the 
man in the moon And though it’s very tiresome for young Pomfret, he’s 
awfully decent and safe If he were strong-minded, of course he’d get out 
of It But I’m rather thankful he’s not, because, if it wasn’t for him it 
might be some fnghtful tick or other ” 

** Is anything hkely to come of it ^ ” 

“ Marriage, do you mean ^ No-o I think he has enough sense of self- 
protection to avoid that And besides — Look here, Miss Vane, it really 
is an awfiil shame Miss Flaxman simply cannot leave anybody alone, and 
she’s trying to get Pomfret away too, though she doesn’t want him If 
only she’d leave poor Violet alone, the whole thing would probably work 
Itself out qmte quietly Mind you, I’m very fond of Violet She’s a 
decent sort, and she’d be absolutely ail right with the right kind of man 
She’s no business to be up at Oxford at all, really A mce domestic life 
with a man to be devoted to is what she really wants But he’d have to be 
a solid, decided kind of man, and fnghtfully affectionate in a firm kind 
of way But not Reggie Pomfret, who is a chivalrous young idiot ” 

Miss Bnggs poked the fire savagely 

“ Well,” said Harriet, “ something has got to be done about all this 

I don’t want to go to the Dean, but ” 

“ Of course, something must be done,” said Miss Bnggs ** It’s extra- 
ordinarily lucky It should have been you who spotted it and not one of 
the dons I’ve been almost wishing that something might happen I’ve 
been fnghtfully worried about it It isn’t the kind of thing I know how 
to cope with at all But I had to stand by Violet more or less — otherwise 
I should simply have lost her confidence altogether and goodness knows 
what stupid thing she’d have done then,” 

” I think you’re quite nght,” said Harriet “ But now, perhaps, I can 
have a word with her and tdl her to mind her step After all, she has got 
112 



to give some guarantee of sensible beha\iour if I^m not to report her to 
the Dean A spot of benevolent blackmail is mdicated, 1 fancy ” 

Yes/* agreed Miss Briggs “ You can do it It*s exceedingly decent 
of you ril be thankful to be relieved of the responsibility It*s all rather 
wearing — and it does upset one’s work After all, work’s what one s here 
for I’\e got Honour Mods next term, and it’s frightfully upsetting, never 
knowing what’s going to happen next ” 

“ I expect Miss Cattermoie relies on you a lot ” 

“ Yes,” said Miss Briggs, “ but hstemng to people’s confidences does 
take such a time, and I’m not awfully good at wrestling with fits of 
temperament ” 

“ The confidante has a very heavy and thankless task,” said Harriet 
“ It’s not surprismg if she goes mad m white Imen It’s more surprising 
if she keeps sane and sensible like you But I agree that you ought to 
have the burden taken off your shoulders. Are you the only one ^ ” 
Pretty well Poor old Violet lost a lot of friends over the uproar ” 
And the business of the anonymous letters ^ ” 

“ Oh, you’ve heard about that^ Well, of course, it wasn’t Violet 
That’s ridiculous But Flaxman spread the story all over the college, and 
once you’ve started an accusation like that, it takes a lot of killing ” 

** It does Well, Miss Briggs, you and I had better get to bed I’ll come 
along and see Miss Cattermoie after breakfast Don’t worry too much I 
dare say this upset will be a blessing in disguise W’’eil, I’ll be going now 
Can you lend me a strong knife ^ ” 

Miss Briggs, rather astonished, produced a stout pen-kmfe and said 
good-mght On her way over to Tudor, Harnet cut down the dangling 
dummy and carried it away with her for scrutiny and action at a later 
hour She felt she badly needed to sleep on the situation 
She must have been weary, for she dropped off as soon as she was m 
bed, and dreamed neither of Peter Wimsey nor of anything else

“ The fact remains,” said Miss Pyke, “ that I have to lecture at nine 
Can anybody lend me a gown ? ” 


11 $ 



A number of the dons were breakfastmg in the S C R dming-room 
Harriet entered m time to hear the request, formulated in a high and 
rather indignant tone 
" Have you lost your gown, hliss Pyke ^ 

** You could have mine with pleasure. Miss Pyke,” said little Miss 
Chilperic, mildly, “ but Pm afraid it wouldn’t be nearly long enough ” 
“ It isn’t safe to leave anything m the SCR cloakroom these days,” 
said Miss Pyke “ I know it was there after dinner, because I saw it ” 

** Sorry,” said Miss Hillyard, “ but I’ve got a 9 o’clock lecture myself ” 
You can have nune,” suggested Miss Burrows, “ if you can get it 
back to me by 10 o’clock ” 

“ Ask Miss de Vine or Miss Barton,” said the Dean ** They have no 
lectures Or Miss Vane — ^hers would fit you ” 

“ Certainly,” said Harriet, carelessly “ Do you want a cap as well ^ ” 
“ The cap has gone as well,” replied Miss Pyke “ I don’t need it for the 
lecture , but it would be convement to know where my property has 
gone to ” 

It’s surprising the way things disappear,” said Harriet, helpmg her- 
self to scrambled eggs “ People are very thoughtless Who, by the way, 
owns a black semi-evemng cr6pe-de-chine, figured with bunches of red 
and green poppies, with a draped cross-over front, deep hip-yoke and 
flared skirt and sleeves about three years out of date ^ ” 

She looked round the dimng-room, which was by now fairly well filled 
with dons “ Miss Shaw — ^you have a very good eye for a frock Can you 
identify it ^ ” 

“ I might if I saw it,” said Miss Shaw “ I don’t recollect one like it 
from your description ” 

“ Have you found one ^ ” asked the Bursar 
** Another chapter m the mystery ^ ” suggested Miss Barton 
“ I’m sure none of my students has one like it,” said Miss Shaw " They 
like to come and show me their frocks I think it’s a good thing to take an 
interest m them ” 

“ I don’t remember a frock like that in the Senior Common Room,” 
said the Bursar 

“ Didn’t IMiss Wrigley have a black figured cr^pe-de-chine ^ ” asked 
Mrs Goodwin 

“Yes,” said Miss Shaw “ But she’s left And anyhow, hers had a 
square neck and no hip-yoke I remember it very well ” 

“ Can’t you tell us what the mystery is, Miss Vane ^ ” inqmred Miss 
Lydgate “ Or is it better that you shouldn’t say anything ^ ” 

“ Well,” said Hamet, “ I don’t see any reason why I shouldn’t tell 
you When I came in last night after my dance I — er — went the rounds 
a bit ” 

“Ah’” said the Dean “ I thought I heard somebody going to and 
fro outside my window And whispenng ” 

114 



“ Yes — Emily came out and caught me I thmk she thought I was tbe 
Practical Joker Well — I happened to go into the Chapel ” 

She told her story, omitting all mention of Mr Pomfret, and merel> 
saying that the culprit had apparently left by the vestry door 

** And,” she concluded, ** as a matter of fact, the cap and gown were 
yours. Miss Pyke, and you can have them any time The bread-kmfe was 
taken from the Hall, presumably, or from here And the bolster — I can’t 
say where they got that ” 

“ I think I can guess,® said the Bursar “ Miss Trotman is away She 
hves on the ground floor of Burleigh It would be easy to nip in and bag 
her bolster ” 

“ Why is Trotman away ^ ” asked hliss Shaw “ She never told me ” 

** Father taken ill,” said the Dean “ She went off in a hurry yesterday 
afternoon ” 

** I can’t flunk why she shouldn’t have told me,” said J^Iiss Shaw “ My 
students always come to me with their troubles It s rather upsetting, 

when you think your pupils value your sympathy ” 

“ But you were out to tea,” said the Treasurer, practically 
“ I put a note m your pigeon-hole,” said the Dean 
“ Oh,” said Miss Shaw “ Well, I didn’t see it I knew nothing about 
it It’s very odd that nobody should ha've mentioned it ” 

“ Who did know it ^ ” asked Harriet 

There was a pause , during which everybody had time to think it 
strange and improbable that Miss Shaw should not have received the 
note or heard of Miss Trotman’s departure 
“ It was mentioned at the High last mght, I think,” said Miss Allison. 
“ I was out to dinner,” said Miss Shaw “ I shall go and see if that 
note’s there ” 

Harnet followed her out , the note was there — a. sheet of paper folded 
together and not sealed in an envelope 
“ Well,” said Miss Shaw , “ I never saw it ” 

“ Anybody might have read that and put it back,” said Harriet 
“ Yes — ^mcluding myself, you mean ” 

“ I didn’t say that, Miss Shaw Anybody ” 

They returned gloomily to the Common Room 
” The — er — the joke was perpetrated between dmner-time, when Miss 
Pyke lost her gown, and about a quarter to one, when I found it out,” 
said Harnet It would be convement if anybody could produce a water- 
tight ahbi for the whole of that time Particularly for the time after 1 1 15 
I suppose I can find out whether any students had late leave till imdmgbt 
Anybody coming m then might have seen something ” 

“ I have a list,” said the Dean “ And the porter could show you the 
names of those who came m after mnc ” 

That wfll be a help ” 

“ In the meantime,” said Miss Pyke, pushing away her plate and 



rolling her napkin, “ the ordinary duties of the day must be proceeded 
with Could I have my gown — or a gown ^ ” 

She went over to Tudor with Harriet, who restored the gown and 
displayed the cr^pe-de-chine frock 

I have never seen that dress to my knowledge before,” said Miss 
Pyke , “ but I cannot pretend to be observant m these matters It appears 
to be made for a slender person of medium height ” 

There’s no reason to suppose it belongs to the person who put it 
there,” said Harriet, “ any moie than your gown ” 

“ Of course not,” said Miss Pyke , “ no ” She gave Harriet an odd, 
swift glance from her sharp, black eyes “ But the owner might provide 
some clue to the thief Would it not — paidon me if I am trepassmg upon 
your province — would it not be possible to draw some deduction from the 
name of the shop where it was bought ^ ” 

“ Obviously it would have been,” said Harriet , “ the tab has been 
removed ” 

“ Oh,” said Miss Pyke “ Well , I must go to my lecture As soon as I 
can find leisure I will endeavour to provide you with a time-table of my 
movements last night I fear, however, it will scarcely be illuminating I 
was in my room after dinner and in bed by half-past ten ” 

She stalked out, carrying hei cap and gown Harriet watched her go, 
and then took out a piece of paper from a drawer The message upon it 
was pasted up in the usual way, and ran 

tnstius hand tilts monstrum nec saevior ulla 
pestis et ira deum Stygiis sese extulit undts 
Virginet voluertm vultus foedissima vmtris 
proluvtes uncaeque manus et pallida semper

“ Harpies,” said Harriet aloud “ Harpies That seems to suggest a 
tram of thought But Pm afraid we can’t suspect Erml> or any of the 
scouts of expressing their feelings in Virgilian hexameteis ” 

She frowned Matters were looking rather bad for the Semor Common 
Room ’ 

• ••••••* 

Harriet tapped on Miss Cattermole^s door, regardless of the fact that 
It bore a large notice headache — ^do not disturb It was opened by 
Miss Bnggs, whose brow was anxious, but cleared when she saw who the 
visitor was 

“ I was afiaid it imght be the Dean,” said Miss Biiggs 
“ No,” said Harnet, ” so far I have held my hand How is the 
patient ” 

** Not too good,” said Miss Briggs 

“Ah * * His lordship has drunk his bath and gone to bed again ’ That’s 
about It, I suppose ” She strode across to the bed and looked down at 
1x6 



Miss Gatterniole, who opened her eyes with a groan They were large, 
light, hazel eves, set in a plump face that ought to have been of a pleasant 
rose-leaf pink A quantity of huffy brown hair tumbled damply about 
her brow, adding to the general impression of an Angora rabbit that had 
gone on the loose and was astonished at the result 

Feeling bloody ^ ” inquired Hamet, with sympathy 
** Horrible,” said Miss Gattermoie 

“ Ser\^e you right,” said Hamel “ If you must take your drink like a 
man, the least you can do is to carry it like a gentleman It’s a great 
thing to know your own limitations ” 

Miss Catteimole looked so woebegone tliat Hamet began to laugh, 

“ You don’t seem to be a very practised hand at this kind of thing Look 
litre , I’ll get you something to puli you together and then I’m going to 
talk to vou ” 

She went out briskly and nearly fell over Mr Pomfret in the outer 
doorway 

” You here ^ ” said Harriet I told you, no visitors in the mormng. 
It makes a noise in the quad and is contrary to legulations ” 

“ I’m not a visitor,” said Mr Pomfret, grinning “ I’ve been attending 
Miss Hillyard’s lecture on Gonstitutional Developments ” 

” God help you * ” 

“ And seeing you cross the quad in this direction, I turned in that 
direction like the needle to the North Dark,” said Mr Pomfret, with 
animation, ” and true and tender is the North That’s a quotation It’s 
very nearly the only one I know, so it’s a good thmg it fits ” 

“ It does not fit I am not feeling tender ” 

Oh ’ how’s Miss Gattermoie ^ ” 

“ Bad hang-over As you might expect ” 

“ Oh * sorry No row, I hope ^ ” 

“ No ” 

“ Bless you ’ ” said Mr Pomfret “ I was lucky too Friend of mme has 
a dashed good window All quiet on the Western Front So — ^look here ! 

I wish there was somethmg I could do to ” 

“ You shall,” said Harriet She twitched his lecture note-book from 
under his arm and scribbled m it 

** Get that made up at the chemist’s and bnng it back I’m damned if 
I want to go myself and ask for a recipe for hobnailed liver ” 

Mr Pomfret looked at her with respect 
Where did you learn that one ^ ” said he 
“ Not at Oxford I may say I have never had occasion to taste it , I 
hope it’s nasty The quicker you can get it made up, the better, by the 
way ” 

I know, I know,” said Mr Pomfret, disconsolately " You’re fed up 
with the sight of me, and no wonder But I do wish you’d come round 
some time and meet old Rogers He’s incredibly penitent Gome and 

117 



have tea Or a drink or something Come this afternoon Do Just to show 
theie’s no lil-feeling 

Harriet was opening her mouth to say Noj when she looked at Mr 
Pomfret, and her heart softened He had the appeal of a very young dog 
of a very large breed — a Lmd of amiable absurdity 

All right,” said Harriet “ I will Thank you very much ” 

Mr Pomfret exhausted himself m expressions of delight, and, still 
vocal, allowed himself to be shepherded to the gate, wheie, almost in the 
act of stepping out, he had to step back to allow the entrance of a tall, 
dark student wheeling a bicycle 

“ Hullo, Reggie ’ ” cried the young woman, “ looking for me ^ ” 

“ Oh, good mormng,” said Mr Pomfiet, lather taken aback Then, 
catching sight of a handsome leomne head over the student’s shoulder, 
he added with more assurance, “ Hullo, Fairingdon • ” 

** Hullo, Pomfret ’ ” replied Mr Farringdon The adjective 
** Byionic ” fitted him well enough, thought Harriet He had an arrogant 
profile, a mass of close chestnut curls, hot brown eyes and a sulky mouth, 
and looked less pleased to see Mr Pomfret than Mr Pomfret to see him 
Mr Pomfret presented Mr Farringdon of New College to Harriet, and 
murmured that of course Miss Flaxman was known to her Miss Flaxman 
stared coolly at Harriet and said how much she had enjoyed her detective 
talk the other night 

« We’re throwing a party at 6 o’clock,” went on Miss Flaxman to Mr 
Pomfret She pulled off her scholar’s gown and stuffed it uncere- 
moniously into her bicycle-basket “ Care to come ^ In Leo’s room 
Six o’clock I think we’ve room for Reggie, haven’t we, Leo ^ ” 

** I suppose so,” said Mr Farrmgdon, rather ungraciously “ There’ll 
be an awful crowd anyway ” 

“ Then we can always stuff in one more,” said Miss Flaxman “ Don’t 
mind Leo, Reggie , he’s mislaid his manners this morning ” 

Mr Pomfret appeared to think that somebody else’s manners had also 
been mislaid, for he replied with more spirit than Harriet had expected 
of him 

“ I’m sorry , I’m afraid I’m engaged Miss Vane is conung to tea with 
me ” 

Another time will do for that,” said Harriet. 

“ Oh, no,” said Mr Pomfret 

“ Couldn’t you both come along, then, afterwards ^ ” said Mr 
Farringdon ** Always room for one more, as Catherine says ” He turned 
to Harriet “ I hope you will come, Miss Vane We should be delighted ” 

“ Well ” said Harriet It was Miss Fiaxman’s.tum to look sulky 

** I say,” said Mr Farnngdon, suddenly putting two and two together, 
** are you the Miss Vane, the novelist ^ You are * Then, look here, 
you simply must come I shall be the most envied man m New College, 
We re all detective fans there ” 
xxB 



** What about it ^ ” said Harriet, defening to Mr Pomfret 
It was so abundantly clear that Miss Fiaxman did not want Harriet, 
that Mr Farrmgdon did not want Mr Pomfret, and that Mr Pomfret 
did not want to go, that she felt the novelist’s mahcious enjoyment m a 
foolish situation Since none of the party could now very well get out of 
the situation without open rudeness, the mvitation was eventually 
accepted Mr Pomfret stepped into the street to join Mr Farrmgdon , 
Miss Flaxman could scarcely get out of accompanying Miss Vane back 
through the quadrangle 

“ I didn’t know you knew Reggie Pomfret,” said Miss Flaxman 
“Yes, we ha\e met,” said Harriet “ \^y didn’t you bring Miss 
Cattermole home with you last mgnt ^ Especially as you must have seen 
she was unwell ” 

Miss Flaxman looked starded 

“ It was nothing to do with me,” she said “ Was there a row ^ ” 

“ No , but did you do anythmg to prevent it ^ You nught have done, 
mightn’t you ^ ” 

“ I can’t be Violet Cattermole’s guardian ” 

“ Any way,” said Harriet, “ you may be glad to know that some good 
has come of this stupid business Miss Cattermole is now definitely cleared 
of all suspicion about the anonymous letters and other disturbances So 
It would be quite a good idea to behave decently to her, don’t you 
think ^ ” 

“ I tell you,” said Miss Flaxman, “ that I don’t care one way or the 
other about it ” 

“ No , but you started the rumours about her , it’s up to you to stop 
them, now you know I think it would be only fair to tell Mr Farrmgdon 
the truth If you do not, I shall ” 

“ You seem to be very much interested in my afiairs. Miss Vane ” 

“ They seem to have aroused a good deal of general interest,” said 
Harriet, bluntly “ I don’t blame you for the original misunderstanding, 
but now that it is cleared up — and you can take my word for it that it 
IS — I am sure you will sec it is unfair that Miss Cattermole should be made 
a scapegoat You can do a lot with your own year Will you do what you 
can ^ ” 

Miss Flaxman, perplexed and annoyed, and obviously not quite clear 
what status she was to accord to Harriet, said, rather grudgingly 
“ Of course, if she didn’t do it, I’m glad Very well I’ll tell Leo ” 

“ Thank you very much,” said Harriet 

Mr Pomfret must have run very fast both ways, for the prescription 
appeared m a remarkably short space of time, along with a large bunch 
of roses The draught was a potent one, and enabled Miss Cattermole 
not only to appear in KM, but to eat hex lundi Harnet pursued her as 
she was leavmg and earned her off to her own room 


110 



Well,” said Harriet, “ you are a young idiot, aren't you > ” 

Miss Gatteimole dismally agreed 

“ What's the sense of it ^ ” said Harriet You have contrived to 
commit every crime in the calendar and got dashed little fun out of it, 
haven't you ^ You've attended a meeting in a man's rooms after Hall 
without leave, and you oughtn't to have got leave, because you gate- 
crashed the meeting That’s a social crime as well as a breach of rules 
In any case, you were out after nme, without putting your initials m the 
book That would cost you two bob You came back to College after 
II 15 without extra late leave — ^which would be five shillings You 
returned, m fact, after midmght, which would be ten shilhngs, even if 
you had had leave You climbed the wall, for which you ought to be 
gated , and finally, you came m blotto, for which you ought to be sent 
down Incidentally, that’s another social crime What have you got to 
say, prisoner at the bar ^ Is there any reason why sentence should not be 
passed upon you ^ Have a cigarette ” 

“ Thank you,” said Miss Gattermole, faintly 

“ If,” said Harriet, ‘‘ you hadn't, by this silly piece of work, contrived 
to clear yourself of the suspicion of being the College lunatic, I should go 
to the Dean As it is, the episode has had its usefulness, and I'm inclined 
to be merciful ” 

Miss Gattermole looked up 
“ Did something happen while I was out ^ ” 

“ Yes, It did ” 

‘‘ Oh — ^h — ^h I ” said Miss Gattermole, and burst into tears 
Harriet watched her for a few minutes and then brought out a large 
clean handkerchief from a drawer and silently handed it over 
** You can forget all that,” said Harriet, when the victim's sobs had 
died down a little ” But do chuck all this nonsense Oxford isn't the 
place for it You can run after young men any time — God knows the 
world's full of them But to waste three years which are unlike anything 
else in one’s lifetime is ridiculous And it isn't fair to College It's not fair 
to other Oxford women Be a fool if you like — I've been a fool in my time 
and so have most people — but for Heaven’s sake do it somewhere where 
you won't let other people down ” 

Miss Gattermole was understood to say, rather mcoherently, that she 
hated College and loathed Oxford, and felt no responsibility towards 
those institutions 

“ Then why,” said Hamet, “ arc you here ^ ” 

“ I don't want to be here , I never did Only my parents were so keen 
My mother's one of those people who work to get things open to women 
—you know — ^professions and things And father's a lecturer in a small 
provinaai Umversity. And they've made a lot of sacrifices and thmgs ” 
Harriet thought Miss Gattermole was probably the sacrificial victim. 
“ I didn't mind coming up, so much,” went on Miss Gattermole ; 


120 



*' because I was engaged to somebody, and he was up, too, and I thought 
it would be fun and the sillv old Schools wouldn’t matter much But I’m 
not engaged to him any more and how on earth can I be expected to 
bother about all this dead-and*gone Historv ^ ” 

“ I wonder they bothered to send you to Oxford, if you didn’t want to 
go, and were engaged ” 

“ Oh 5 but they said that didn’t make any difference Every woman 
ought to have a Um\ersity education, even if she manied And mw^ of 
course, they sa^ what a good thing it is I sldl have my College career. 
And I can’t make them understand that I hate it * They can’t see that 
being brought up '^vith everybody talking education all round one is 
enough to make one loathe the sound of it I’m sick of education ’* 
Harriet was not surprised 

“ What should >ou have liked to do ^ I mean, supposing the 
complication about vour engagement hadn’t happened ^ ” 

“ I think,” said Miss Gattermole, blowmg her nose in a final manner 
and taking another cigarette, ** I tlunk I should have kked to be a rook 
Or possibly a hospital nurse, but I think I should have been better at 
cooking Only, you see, those are two of tlie things Mother’s always 
trying to get people out of the way of thinking women’s sphere ought to 
be restncted to ” 

“ There’s a lot of money m good cooking,” said Harriet 
“ Yes — but It’s not an educational advance Besides, there’s no school 
of Cookery at Oxford, and it had to be Oxford, you see, or Cambndge, 
because of the oppoitumty of making the right kind of fnends Only I 
haven’t made any fnends They all hate me Perhaps they won’t so much, 
now that the beastly letters ” 

“ Quite so,” said Harnet, hastily, fearing a fresh outburst “ How 
about Miss Briggs ^ She seems to be a very good sort ” 

She’s awfully kind But I’m always having to be grateful to her It’s 
very depressing. It makes me want to bite ” 

“ How right you are,” said Harnet, to whom this was a direct hit over 
the solar plexus “ I know Gratitude is simply damnable ” 

“ And now,” said Miss Gattermole, with devastating candour, “ I’ve 
got to be grateful to you ” 

“ You needn’t be I was serving my own ends as much as yours. But 
I’ll tell you what I’d do I’d stop trying to do sensational things, because 
It’s apt to get you into positions where you have to be grateful And I’d 
stop chasing undergraduates, because it bores them to teais and inter- 
rupts their work I’d tackle the History and get through Schools. And 
then I’d turn round and say, ‘ Now I’ve done what you want me to, and 
I’m going to be a cook ’ And stick to it ” 

“ Would you ^ ” 

“ I expect you want to be very truly run after, like Old Man Kangaroo 
Well, good cooks are Still, as you’ve started here on History, you’d 

X2I 



better worry on at it It won’t hurt you, you know If you learn how to 
tackle one subject— any subject — you’ve learnt how to tackle all 
subjects ” 

“ Weil,” said Miss Gattermole, m rather an unconvinced tone, “ Fll 
try” 

Harriet went away in a rage and tackled the Dean 
“ Why do they send these people here ^ Making themselves miser- 
able and taking up the place of people who would enjoy Oxford ^ We 
haven’t got room for women who aren’t and never will be scholars It’s 
all right for the men’s colleges to have hearty passmen who gambol 
round and learn to play games, so that they can gambol and game in 
Prep Schools But this dreary little devil isn’t even hearty She’s a wet 
mess ” 

“ I know,*^ said the Dean, impatiently “ But schoolmistresses and 
parents are such jugginses We do our best, but we can’t always weed out 
their mistakes And here’s my secretary — called away, just when we’re 
all so busy, because her tiresome little boy’s got chicken-pox at his 
infuriating school Oh, dear * I oughtn’t to talk like that, because he’s a 
dehcate child and naturally children must come first, but it is too 
crushing ' ” 

I’ll be off,” said Harriet “ It’s a shame you should have to be work- 
ing of an afternoon and a shame of me to interrupt By the way, I may 
as well tell you that Gattermole had an alibi for last night’s affair ” 

Had she ^ Good * That’s something Though I suppose it means 
more suspicion on our miserable selves Still, facts are facts Miss Vane, 
what was the noise in the quad last mght ^ And who was the young man 
you were beai -leading ^ I didn’t ask this mormng m Gommon-Room, 
because I had an idea you didn’t want me to ” 

“ I didn’t,” said Harriet 
“ And you don’t ^ ” 

As Sherlock Holmes said on another occasion ‘ I think we must ask 
for an amnesty in that direction ’ ’ 

The Dean twinkled shrewdly at her 
Two and two make four Well, I trust you ” 

** But I was gomg to suggest a row of revolving spikes on the wall of 
the Fellows’ Garden ” 

“ Ah * ” said the Dean ** Well, I don’t want to know things And most 
of it’s sheer cussedness They want to make heroes and heroines of them- 
selves Last week of term’s the worst for wall-climbmg They make bets 
Have to work ’em off before the end of term Tiresome little cuckoos 
Ail the same, it can’t be allowed ” 

It won’t happen again, I fancy, with this particular lot ” 

“ Very well I’ll speak to the Bursar — ^m a general way — about spikes ” 


122 



Harriet changed her frock, pondering on the social absurdities of the 
party to which she was invited Clearly, Mr Poinfret clung to her as a 
protection against Miss Flaxman, and Mr Farnngdon, as a protection 
against Mr Pomfret, while Miss Flaxman, who was apparently her 
hostess, did not want her at all It was a pity that she could not embark 
on the adventure of annexing Mr Farnngdon, to complete a neat httle 
tail-chasmg circle But she was both too old and too young to feel any 
thrill over the Byromc profile of Mr Farnngdon , there was more amuse- 
ment to be had out of remaimng a buffer state She did, however, feel 
sufficient resentment against Miss Flaxman for her handling of the 
Gattermole affair, to put on an exceedingly well-cut coat and skirt and 
a hat of unexceptionable smartness, before startmg out for tiie first item 
in her afternoon’s programme 

She had little difficulty m finding Mr Pomfret’s staircase, and none 
whatever in finding Mr Pomfret As she wound her way up the daik 
and ancient stairs, past the shut door of one Mr Smith, the spoited oak 
of one Mr Banerjee, and the open door of one Mr Hodges, who 
seemed to be enteitammg a large and noisy party of male friends, she 
became aware of an altercation going on upon the landing above, and 
presently Mr Pomfret himself came into view, standing in his own door- 
way and arguing with a man whose back was turned towards the stairs 
You can go to the devil,” said Mr Pomfret 
** Very good, sir,” said the back , “ but how about me going to the 
young lady ^ If I was to go and tell her that I seen you a-pushmg of her 
over the wall ” 

“ Blast you ’ ” exclaimed Mr Porafiet “ Will you shut up ^ ” 

At this point, Harriet set her foot upon the top stair, and encountered 
the eye of Mr Pomfret 

“ Oh ’ ’ said Mr Pomfret, taken aback Then, to the man, “ Clear 
off now , I’m busy You’d better come agam ” 

Quite a man for the ladies, ain’t you, sir ^ ” said the man, disagree- 
ably 

At these words, he turned, and, to her amazement, Harriet recognised 
a familiar face 

“ Dear me. Jukes,” said she “ Fancy seemg you here * ” 

“ Do you know this blighter ^ ” said IVIr Pomfret 
“ Of course I do,’' said Harriet “ He was a porter at Shrewsbury, and 
was sacked for petty pilfering I hope you’ie gomg straight now. Jukes 
How’s your wife ^ ” 

All right,” said Jukes, sulkily “ I’ll come agam ” 

He made a move to slip down the staircase, but Hairiet had set her 
umbrella so awkwardly across it as to bar the way pretty effectively 
“ Hi * ” said Mr Pomfret “ Let’s hear about this Just come back here 
a minute, will you ^ ” He stretched out a powerful arm, and yanked the 
reluctant Jukes over the threshold

You can*t get me on that old business,®’ said Jukes, scornfully, as 
Haruet followed them m, shutting oak and door after hei with a bang 
“ That’s over and done with It ain’t got nothing to do witli that other 
httle affair what I mentioned ” 

What’s that ^ ” asked Harriet 

“ This nasty piece of work,” said Mr Ponifret, “ has had the blasted 
neck to come here and say that if I don’t pay him to keep his mouth shut, 
he’ll lay an information about what happened last mght ” 

** Blackmail,” said Harriet, much interested “ That’s a senous 
offence ” 

“ I didn’t mention no money,” said Jukes, injured I only told this 
gentleman as I seen something as didn’t ought to ha\ e happened and was 
uneasy in mv mind about it He says I can go to the devil, so I says in 
that case I’ll go to the ladv, being troubled in my conscience, don’i ;yrOu 
see ” 

“ Very well,” said Harriet “ I’m here Go ahead ” 

Mr Jukes stared at her 

** I take it,” said Harriet, >ou saw Mr Poinfret help me in over the 
Shrewsbury wall last mght when I’d foi gotten my key What w^ere you 
doin| out there, by the way ^ Loitering with intent ^ You then probably 
saw me come out again, thank Mr Pomfret and ask him to come in and 
see the College Buildings by moonlight If you waited long enough, you 
saw me let him out again What about it ^ ” 

** Nice goings-on, I don’t think,” said Jukes, disconcerted 
** Possibly,” said Harriet “ But if Senior Members choose to enter 
their own college in an unorthodox way, I don’t see who’s to prevent 
them Certainly not you ” 

“ I don’t believe a word of it,” said Jukes 

** I can’t help tnat,” said Harriet The Dean saw Mr Pomfret and 
me, so she wtlU Nobody’s likely to believe you Why didn’t you tell this 
man the whole story at once, Mr Poinfret, and relieve his conscience ^ 
By the way, Jukes, I’ve just told the Dean she ought to ha-ve that w^all 
spiked It was handy for us, but it really isn’t high enough to keep out 
buiglars and other undesirables So it’s not much good vour loitering 
about there any more One or two things have been missed from people’s 
rooms lately,” she added, \vith some truth, “ it might be as well to have 
that road specially policed ” 

“ None of that,” said Jukes “ I ain’t a-going to have my character 
took away If it’s as you say, then I’m sure I’d be the last to want to make 
trouble for a lady like yourself” 

I hope you’ll bear that m mind,” said Mr Pomfiet “ Perhaps you’d 
like to have something to remember it by ” 

“ No assault ’ ” cried Jukes, backing towards the door “ No assault * 
Don’t you go to lay ’ands on me * ” 

“ If ever you show your dirty face here again,” said Mr Ponifret, 
124 



opening the door, ** 1*11 kick yon downstairs and right through the quad 
Get that ^ Then get out f ” 

He flung the oak back ^vith one hand and propelled Jukei> vigorousl> 
through It with the other A crash and a curae proclaimed ihat the 
swiftness of Jukes’s exit had carried him o\ er the head of the stairs 
“ Whew * ” exclaimed Mr Pomfret, returning “ By jove * that was 
great * That was marv^ellous of you Plow did you come to think of it ^ ” 

“ It was fairly obvious I expect it was all bluff, really I don’t see how 
he could have known who Miss Gattermole was I wonder how he got on 
to you ” 

** He must have followed me back when I came out But I didn’t get 

m through this window — obviously — so how did he ^ Oh* yes, when 

I knocked Brown up I believe he stuck his head out and said ‘ That you, 
Poznfiet ^ ’ Gaieless blighter I’ll talk to him I say, you do seem 

to be everybody’s guardian angel, don’t >ou ^ It’s marvellous, being 
able to keep your wits about you like that ” 

He gazed at her with dog-like eves Harriet laughed, as Mr Rogers 
and the tea entered the room together 
Mr Rogers was in his third year — tail, daik, lively and full of an easy 
kind of penitence 

“ Ail this running round and busting rules is rot,” said Mr Rogers 
“ \Yhv do we do it ^ Because somebody says it is fim, and one beheves it 
Why should one believe it ^ I can’t imagine One should look at these 
things more objectively Is the thing beautiful m itself^ No Then let us 
not do it B> the way, Pomfret, have you been approached about 
dcbaggmg Culpepper ^ ” 

“ I am ail for it,” said Mr Pomfret 

“ True, Culpepper is a wart He is a disgusting object But would he 
look any better debagged ^ No, Socrates, he would not. He would look 
much worse If anybody is to be debagged, it shall be somebody with 
legs that will stand exposure — ^your own, Pomfret, for example ” 

“ You try, that’s all,” said Mr Pomfret 

“ In any case,” pursued Mr Rogers, “ debaggmg is otiose and out of 
date The modem craze for exposing anaesthetic legs needs no encourage- 
ment from me I shall not be a party to it I mtend to be a reformed 
character From now on, I shall consider nothmg but the value of the 
Thmg-m-Itself, unmoved by any pressure of public opimon ” 

Having, m this pleasant manner, confessed his sms and promised 
amendment, Mr Rogers gracefully led the conveisation to topics of 
general interest, and, about 5 o’clock, departed, murmurmg something 
in an apologetic way about work and his tutor, as though they were 
rather indelicate necessities At this point, Mr Pomfret suddenly went 
all solemn, as a very young man occasionally does when alone with a 
woman older than himself, and told Harriet a good deal about his own 
view of the meamng of life Harriet listened with as much mtelligent 

125 



sympathy as she could command , but was slightly lelieved when three 
young men burst m to borrow Mr Pomfret’s beer and remained to argue 
over their host^s head about Komisarjevsky Mr Pomfret seemed 
famtly annoyed, and eventually asserted his nght to his own guest by 
announcing that it was time to pop roimd to New College for old 
Farringdon’s party His friends let him go with mild regret and, before 
Harriet and her escort were well out of the room, took possession of their 
armchairs and continued the argument 

“ Very able fellow, Marston,*’ said Mr Pomfret, amiably enough 
“ Great noise on O U D S and spends his vacations in Germany I don’t 
know how they contrive to get so worked up about plays I like a good 
play, but I don’t understand all this stuff about stylistic treatment and 
planes of vision I expect you do, though ” 

“ Not a word,” said Harriet, cheerfully “ I daie say they don’t, 
either Anyhow, I know I don’t like plays in which all the actors 
have to keep on tumbling up and down flights of steps, or where the 
lighting’s so artistically done that you can’t see anything, or where you 
keep on wondering all the time what the symbolical whirligig m the 
centre of the stage is going to be used for, if anything It distracts me I’d 
rather go to the Holborn Empire and have my fun vulgar ” 

Would you ^ ” said Mr Pomfret, wistfully “ You wouldn’t come 
and do a show with me in Town in the vac, would you ^ ” 

Harnet made a vague kind of promise, which seemed to delight 
Mr Pomfret very much, and they presently found themselves m Mr 
Famngdon’s sitting-room, packed like sardines among a mixed crowd 
of undergraduates and struggling to consume sherry and biscuits without 
moving then elbows 

The crowd was such that Harnet never set eyes on Miss Flaxman from 
first to last Mr Farnngdon did, however, struggle through to them, 
brmgmg with him a bunch of young men and women who wanted to 
talk about detective fiction They appeared to have read a good deal of 
this kind of literature, though very little of anything else A School of 
Detective Fiction would, Harriet thought, have a fair chance of pro- 
ducmg a goodly crop of Firsts The fashion for psychological analysis had, 
she decided, rather gone out since her day , she was instinctively aware 
that a yearning for action and the concrete was taking its place The 
pre-War solemnity and the post-War exhaustion were both gone , the 
desire now was for an energetic domg of something defimte, though the 
dcfimtions differed The detective story, no doubt, was acceptable, 
because in it something definite was done, the what ” being comfort- 
ably decided, beforehand by the author It was borne m upon Harnet 
that all these young men and women were starting out to hoe a hardish 
kind of row m a very stony groimd She felt rather sorry for them 



Something definite done Yes, indeed Harriet, reviewing the situation 
next mormng, felt deeply dissatisfied She did not like this Jukes business 
at ail He could scarcely, she supposed, have anything to do with the 
anonymous letters where could he have got hold of that passage from 
the Aeneid ^ But he was a man ^vith a grudge, a nasty-minded man, and 
a thief , It was not pleasant that he should make a habit of hanging 
round the College walls after dark 

Harriet was alone in the Semor Common Room, everybody else 
having departed to her work The SCR scout came m, carrying a pile 
of clean ash-trays, and Harriet suddenly remembered that her children 
lodged with the Jukeses 

“ Anme,’’ she said, mipulsively, “ what does Jukes come down into 
Oxford for, after daik ^ ” 

The woman looked startled “ Does he, madam ^ For no good, I 
should think 

“ I found him loitering m St Cross Road last mght, in a place where 
he might easily get over Is he keeping honest, do you know ^ ” 

“ I couldn’t say, Pm sure, madam, but I have my doubts I like Mrs 
Jukes very much, and I’d be sorry to add to her troubles But I never 
have trusted Jukes I’ve been thinking I ought to put my little girls 
somewhere else He might be a bad influence on them, don’t you think ? ” 

“ I certainly do think so ” 

“I’m the last peison to wish to put diflSculties m the way of a 
respectable married woman,” went on Annie, slapping an ash-tray 
smartly down, “ and naturally she’s right to stick by her husband But 
one’s own children must come first, mustn’t they ^ ” 

“ Of course,” said Harriet, rather inattentively “ Oh, yes I should 
find somewhere else for them I suppose you haven’t ever heard either 
Jukes or his wife say anything to suggest that he — well, that he was 
stealing from the College or cherishmg bad feelings against the dons.” 

“ I don’t have much to say to Jukes, madam, and if Mrs Jukes knew 
anything, she wouldn’t tell me It w^ouldn’t be right if she did He’s her 
husband, and she has to take his part I quite see that But if Jukes is 
behaving dishonestly, I shall have to find somewhere else for the children 
I’m much obliged to you for mentioning it, madam I shall be gomg 
round there on Wednesday, which is my free afternoon, and 1*11 take the 
opportumty to give notice May I ask if you have said anything to Jukes, 
madam ^ ” 

“ I have spoken to him, and told him that if he hangs round here any 
more he wall have to do with the police ” 

“ I’m very glad to hear that, madam It isn’t right at all that he should 
come here like that If I’d knowm about it, I really shouldn’t have been 
able to sleep I feel sure it ought to be put a stop to ” 

“ Yes, It ought By the way, Annie, ^ve you ever seen anybody m the 
College in a dress of this dcscnption ^ ” 


127 



Harriet picked up the black figured crepe-de-chine from the chair 
beside her Annie examined it carefully 

“ No, madam, not to my recollection Perhaps one of the maids that’s 
been here longer than me might know There’s Gertrude in the dimng- 
room , should you like to ask her ^ ’* 

Gertrude, however, could give no help Harriet asked them to take the 
dress and catechise the rest of the staff This was done, but with no 
result An inquiry among the students produced no identification, either* 
The dress was brought back, still unclaimed and unrecognised One more 
puzzle Harriet concluded that it must actually be the property of the 
Poison-Pen , but if so, it must have been brought to College and kept m 
hiding till the moment of its dramatic appearance in Chapel , for if it 
had ever been worn m College, it was almost inconceivable that no one 
should be able to recognise it 

The alibis produced, meelly enough, by the members of the S G R 
were none of them water-tight That was not surprising , it would have 
been more surprising if they had been Harriet (and Mr Pomfret, of 
course) alone knew the exact time for which the alibi was required , and 
though many people were able to show themselves covered up to mid- 
mght or thereabouts, all had been, or claimed to have been, virtuously 
in their own rooms and beds by a quarter to one Nor, though the porter's 
book and late-leave tickets had been examined, and all students inter- 
rogated who might have been about the quad at midmght, had anybody 
seen anv suspicious behaviour with gowns or bolsters or bread-kmves 
Cnme was too easy m a place like this The College was too big, too open 
Even if a form had been seen crossing the quad with a bolster, or indeed 
for that matter a complete set of bedding and a mattress, nobody would 
ever think anything of it Some hardy fresh-air fiend sleeping out , that 
would be the natural conclusion. 


Harriet, exasperated, went over to Bodley and plunged into her 
researches upon Lefanu There, at least, one did know what one was 
investigating 


She felt so much the need of a soothing influence that, in the afternoon, 
she went down to Ghnst Church to hear service at the Cathedral She 
had been shoppmg — purchasing, among other things, a bag of meringues 
for the entertainment of some students she had asked lo a small party in 
her room that evening — and it was only when her arms were already full 
of parcels that the idea of Cathedral suggested itself It was rather out of 
her way , but the parcels were not heavy She dodged across Carfax, 
angnly resenting its modern bustle of cars and comphcation of stop-and- 
128 



go lights, and joined the little spnnkhng of foot-passengers who were 
tripping down St Aldate’s and through Wolsey’s great unfinished 
quadrangle, bound on the same pious errand as herself 
It was quiet and pleasant in Cathedral She hngered in her seat for 
some little time after the nave had emptied and until the orgamst had 
finished the voluntary Then she came slowly out, turning left along the 
plinth with a vague idea of once more admiring the great staircase and 
the Hall, when a slim figure in a grey suit shot with such velocity from 
a dark doorway that he cannoned full tilt against her, nearly knocking 
her down, and sending her bag and parcels fiymg m disorder along the 
plinth 

“ Hell * ** said a voice w^hich set her heart beating by its unexpected 
famihanty, ‘‘ have I hurt you ^ Me all over — ^bargin* and bumpin* 
about like a bumble-bee in a bottle Clumsy lout * I say, do say I haven’t 
hurt YOU Because, if I have, I’ll run straight across and drown myself in 
Mercury ” 

He extended the arm that was not supporting Harriet in a vague 
gesture towards the pond 

“ Not in the least, thank you,” said Harriet, recoveimg herself 
Thank God for that This is my unlucky day I’ve just had a most 
unpleasant interview with the Jumor Censor Was there anything 
breakable m the parcels ^ Oh, look • your bag’s opened itself wide and 
all the little oojahs have gone down the steps Please don’t move You 
stand there, thinkin’ up things to call me, and I’ll pick ’em all up one by 
one on my knees sayin’ * meS. culpSt * to every one of ’em ” 

He suited the action to the words 

“ I’m afraid it hasn’t improved the meringues ” He looked up apolo- 
getically “ But if you’ll say you forgive me, we’ll go and get some new 
ones from the kitchen — the real kind— know — speciality of the House, 
and all that ” 

“ Please don’t bother,” said Harnet 

It wasn’t he, of course This was a lad of twenty-one or tw^o at the most, 
with a mop of wavy hair tumbhng over his forehead and a handsome, 
petulant face, full of charm, though ominously weak about the curved 
lips and upward-slanting brow^ But the colour of the hair was nght — 
the pale yellow of npe barley , and the hght drawling voice, with its 
clipped syllables and reaay babble of speech , and the qmck, sidelong 
smile , and above all, the beautiful, sensitive hands that were gathering 
the “ oojahs ” deftly up into their native bag 
“ You haven’t called me any names yet,” said the young man 
“ I believe I could almost put a name to you,” said Harriet “ Isn’t it 
— are you any relation of Peter Wimsey’s ^ ” 

“ Why, of course,” said the young man, sitting up on his heels “ He’s 
my unde , and a dashed sight more accommodating than the Jewish 
kind,” he added, as though struck by a melancholy association of ideas 
ojsr —5 139 



Have I met you somewhere ^ Or was it pure guesswork ^ You don’t 
think Fm like him, do you ^ ” 

** When >ou spoke, I thought you were your uncle for the moment 
Yes, you’re very like him, in some ways ” 

“ That’ll break my mater’s heart, all right,” said the young man, with 
a grin “ Uncle Peter’s not approved I wish to God he was here, though 
He’d come m uncommonly handy at the moment But he seems to have 
beetled off somewhere as usual Mysterious old tom-cat, isn’t he ^ I take 
it you know him — I foigot the proper bromide about how small the 
world is, but we’ll take it as read Where ts the old blighter ^ ” 

I believe he’s m Rome ” 

“ He would be That means a letter It’s awfully haid to be persuasive 
in a letter, don’t you think ^ I mean, it all takes so much explaimng, and 
the famous family charm doesn’t seem to go over so well m black and 
white ” 

He smiled at her witli engaging frankness as he recaptured a last 
straying copper 

** Do I gathei,” said Harriet, with some amusement, “ that you 
anticipate an appeal to Uncle Peter’s better feelings ^ ” 

** That’s about it,” said the young man “ He’s quite human, really, 
you know, if you go about him tlie right way Besides, you see, I’ve got 
the bulge on Uncle Peter If the worst comes to the worst, I can always 
threaten to cut my tliroat and land him with the strawberry leaves * 

“ With the what ^ ” said Harriet, fancying that tins must be the latest 
Oxford version of giving the raspberry 
“ The strawberry leaves,” said the young man The balm, the 
sceptre, and the ball Foui rows of moth-eaten ermine To say nothing 
of that dashed great barracks down at Denver, eating its mouldy head 
off” Seeing that Harnet still looked blankly at him, he explained 
further “ I’m sorry , I forgot My name’s Saint-George and the 
Governor forgot to provide me with any brothers So the minute they 
write d s p after me, Uncle Peter’s for it Of course, my father might 
outlive him , but I don’t believe Uncle Peter’s the sort to die young, 
unless one of his pet criminals manages to bump him off” 

“ That might easily happen,” said Harriet, thinking of the plug-ugly 
“ Weil, that makes it all the woise for him,” said Lord Saint-George, 
shaking his head “ The more risks he takes, the quicker he’s got to toe 
the hne for the matrimonial stakes No more bachelor freedom with old 
Bunter m a Piccadilly flat And no more spectacular Viennese singers 
So you see, it’s as much as his life’s worth to let anything happen to me ” 
“ Obviously,” said Harnet, fascmated by this new light on the subject 
‘‘Uncle Peter’s weakness,” went on Lord Saint-George, carefully 
disentangling the squashed menngues from their paper, “is his strong 
sense of public duty You mightn’t think it to look at him, but it’s there 
(Shall we try these on the carp ^ I don’t think they’re really fit for human 
ISO 



consumption ) He’s kept out of it so far — he’s an obstinate old devil 
Says he’ll have the right wife or none ” 

But suppose the right one says No 

“ That’s the story he puts up I don’t believe a word of it '^Vhy should 
anybody object to Uncle Peter ^ He’s no beautv and he’d talk the hind 
leg off a donkey , but he’s dashed well-off and he’s got good manners and 
he’s m the stud-book ” He balanced himself on the edge of \lercurv and 
peered into its tranqmi waters * Look • there’s the big old one Been 
here since the foundation, by the looks of him — see him go ^ Cardinal 
Wolsey’s particular pet ” He tossed a crumb to the great hsh, which took 
It With a quick snap and submerged again 

I don’t know how well you know my uncle,” he proceeded, but if 
you do get a chance, you rmght let him know that when you saw me I was 
looking rather unwell and hag-ndden and hinted darJsIy at felo-de-se ” 

“ I’ll make a pomt of it,” said Harnet “ I will say you seemed 
scarcely able to crawl and, in fact, fainted mto my arms, accidentally 
crushing all my parcels He won’t beheve me, but I’ll do mv best ” 

“ No — he isn’t good at believing things, confound him I’m afraid I 
shall have to write, after all, and produce the evidence Still, I don’t know 
why I should bore you with my personal affairs Come on down to the 
kitchen ” 

The Christ Church cook was well pleased to produce meringues from 
the ancient and famous College oven , and when Harnet had duly 
admired the vast fireplace with its shming spits and heard statistics of 
the number of joints roasted and the quantity of fuel consumed per week 
m term-time, she followed her guide out into the quadrangle again with 
all proper expressions of gratitude 

“ Not at all,” said the viscount “ Not much return, I’m afraid, after 
banging you all over the place and throwing your property about May 
I know, by the way, whom I have had the honour of inconvemencmg ^ ” 

“ My name’s Harnet Vane ” 

Lord Samt-George stood still, and smote himself heavily over the 
forehead 

“ My God, what have I done ^ Miss Vane, I do beg your pardon — 
and throw myself abjectly on your mercy If my uncle hears about this 
he’ll never forgive me, and I shall cut my throat It is borne m upon me 
that I have said every possible thing I should not ” 

“ It’s my fault,” said Harnet, seeing that he looked really alarmed, 
“ I ought to have warned you ” 

“ As a matter of fact, I’ve no business to say thmgs like that to anybody 
I’m afraid I’ve mhented my uncle’s tongue and my mother’s want of 
tact Look here, for God’s sake forget all that rot Uncle Peter’s a dashed 
good sort, and as decent as they come ” 

“ I’ve reason to know it,” said Harnet 

“ I suppose so By the way — hell ’ I seem to be putting my foot m it

all round, but I ought to explain that I’ve never hcaid him talk about 
you I mean, he’s not that sort It’s my mother She says all kinds of 
things Sorry I’m making things worse and worse ” 

Don’t worry,” saidHarriet “After all, I cfoknow youruncle, you know 
—well enough, anyhow, to know what sort he is And I certainly won’t 
give you away ” 

“ For Heaven’s sake, don’t It isn’t only that I’d never get anything 
more out of him— and I’m in a devil of a mess — but he makes one fed 
such an appalling tick I don’t suppose you’ve ever been given the wrong 
side of my uncle’s tongue — naturally not But of the two, I recommend 
skinmng ” 

“ We’re both m the same boat I’d no business to listen Good-bye — 
and many thanks for the meringues ” 

She was half-way up St Aldate’s when the viscount caught her up 

“ I say— I’ve just remembered That old story I was ass enough to 
rake up ” 

“ The Viennese dancer ^ ” 

“ Singer— music’s his line Please forget that I mean, it’s got whiskers 
on it — It’s six years old, anyway I was a kid at school and I dare say it’s 
all rot ” 

Harnet laughed, and promised faithfully to forget the Viennese 
singer

PIERRE ERONBELL 

“ So,” said the Bursar, coming bnskly up to the High Table for lunch 
on the following Thursday , “Jukes has come to grief once more ” 
“ Has he been steaimg again ^ ” asked Miss Lydgate “ Dear me, how 
disappointing * ” 

“ Annie tells me she’s had her suspicions for some time, and yester- 
day being her half-day she went down to tell Mrs Jukes she would have 
to place the children somewhere else — ^when lo, and behold * in walked 
the pohce and discovered a whole lot of things that had been stolen a 
X32 



fortmght ago from an undergraduate’s rooms m Holywell It was most 
unpleasant for her — ^for Anme, I mean They asked her a lot of 
questions ” 

“ I always thought it was a mistake to put those children there,” said 
the Dean 

** So that’s what Jukes did with himself at mght,” said Harriet I 
heard he’d been seen outside the College here As a matter of fact, I gave 
Anme the tip It’s a pity she couldn’t have removed the children earlier ” 
I thought he was doing quite well,” said Miss Lydgate ** He had a 
job — and I know he kept chickens — and there was the money for the 
little Wilsons, Anme’s children, I mean — so he ought not to have needed 
to steal, poor man Perhaps Mrs Jukes is a bad manager ” 

“Jukes IS a bad lot,” said Harriet “ A nasty bit of business altogether 
He’s much best out of the way ” 

“ Had he taken much ^ ” inquired the Dean 

“ I gather from Anme,” said the Bursar, “ that they rather think they 
can trace a lot of petty thieving to Jukes I understand it’s a question of 
finding out where he sold the things ” 

“ He’d dispose of them through a fence, I suppose,” said Harriet , 
“ some pawnbroker or somebody of that kmd Has he been inside—in 
prison — before ^ ” 

“ Not that I know of,” said the Dean , “ though he ought to have 
been ” 

“ Then I suppose he’ll get off lightly as a first offender ” 

“ Miss Barton will know all about that We’ll ask her I do hope poor 
Mrs Jukes isn’t involved,” said the Bursar. 

“ Surely not,” cned Miss Lydgate, “ she’s such a mce woman ” 

“ She must have known about it,” said Hamet, “ unless she was a 
perfect imbecile ” 

“ What a dreadful thing, to know your husband was a thief • ” 

“ Yes,” said the Dean “ It would be very uncomfortable to have to 
live on the proceeds ” 

“ Terrible,” said Miss Lydgate “ I can’t imagine anything more 
dieadful to an honest person’s feelings ” 

“ Then,” said Harriet, “ we must hope, for Mis Jukes’s sake, she was 
as guilty as he was ” 

“ What a horrible hope * ” exclaimed Miss Lydgate 
“ Well, she’s got to be either guilty or unhappy,” said Hamet, passing 
the bread to the Dean with a twinkle in her eye 
“ I dissent altogether,” said Miss Lydgate “ She must either be 
innocent and unhappy or gmlty and unhappy — I don’t see how she can 
be happy, poor creature ” 

“ Let us ask the Warden next time we see her,” said !Miss Martin, 
“ whether it is possible for a gmlty person to be happy And if so, whether 
It IS better to be happy or virtuous ” 


m 



" Gome, Dean,** said the Bursar, “ we can’t allow this sort of thing. 
Miss Vane, a bowl of hemlock for the Dean, if you please To return to 
the subject under discussion, the police ha\e not, so far, taken up Mrs 
Jukes, so I suppose there’s nothing against her ” 

I’m very glad of that,” said Miss Lydgate , and, Mxss Shaw arriving 
at that moment, full of woe about one of her pupils who was suffering 
from perpetual headache, and aii mcapacity to work, the conversation 
wandered into other channels 

Term was drawing to a close, and the investigation seemed little 
farther advanced , but it appeared possible that Harriet’s nightly per- 
ambulations and tiie frustration of the Library and Chapel scandals had 
exercised a restraining influence on the Poltergeist, for there was no 
further outbieaL of any kind, not so much as an inscription m a lavator> 
or an anonymous letter, for three days The Dean, exceedingly busy, was 
relieved by the respite, and also cheered by the news that Mrs Goodvvun 
the secretary would be back on the Monday to cope with the end-of- 
term rush Miss Gattermole was seen to be more cheerful, and wrote a 
quite respectable paper for Miss Hillyard about the naval policy of 
Henry VIII Harriet asked the enigmatic Miss de Vine to coffee As 
usual, she had intended to lay bare Miss de Vine’s soul, and, as usual, 
found herself laying bare her own 

** I quite agree with you,” said Miss de Vine, “ about the difficulty of 
combining intellectual and emotional interests I don’t think it affects 
women only , it affects men as well But when men put their public lives 
before their pnvate hves, it causes less outcry than when a woman does 
the same thmg, because women put up with neglect better than men, 
having been brought up to expect it ” 

“ But suppose one doesn’t quite know which one wants to put first 
Suppose,” said Harriet, falling back on words which were not her own, 
” suppose one is cursed mth both a heart and a brain ^ ” 

“ You can usually tell,” said Miss de Vine, “ by seeing what kind of 
mistakes you make I’m quite sure that one never makes fundamental 
mistakes about the thing one really wants to do Fundamental mistakes 
arise out of lack of genume interest In my opimon, that is ” 

** I made a very big mistake once,” said Hamet, “ as I expect you 
know I don’t think that arose out of lack of interest It seemed at the 
time the most important thing m the world ” 

“ And yet you made the mistake. Were you really giving all your mind 
to It, do you think ^ Your mtnd’^ Were you really being as cautious and 
exacting about it as you would be about writing a passage of fine prose ^ ” 
“ That’s rather a difficult sort of comparison One can’t, surely, deal 
with emotional excitements m that detached spirit ” 

“ Isn’t the wntmg of good prose an emotional excitement ” 

134 



Yesj of course it is. At least, when you get the thing dead right and 
know it’s dead right, there’s no excitement like it It’s marvellous It 
makes you feel like God on the Seventh Day — ^for a bit, anyhow ” 

“ Well, that s what I mean You expend the trouble and you don’t 
make any mistake — and thea you experience the ecstasy But if there’s 
any subject m which you’re content with tlie second-rate, then it isn’t 
really your subject ” 

“ You’re dead right,” said Harriet, after a pause “ If one’s genuinely 
interested one knows how to be patient, and let time pass, as Queen 
Elizabeth said Perhaps that’s the meamng of the phrase about genius 
being eternal patience, which I always thought rather absurd If you 
truly want a thing, vou don’t snatch , if you snatch, you don’t really 
want it Do you suppose that, if you find yourself taking pains about a 
thmg, It’s a proof of its importance to you ^ ” 

** I think it is, to a large extent But the big proof is that the thixig 
comes right, without those fundamental errors One always makes 
surface errors, of course But a fundamental error is a sure sign of not 
caring I wish one could teach people nowadays that the doctrine of 
snatclnng what one thinks one wants is unsound ” 

I saw six plays this winter m London,” said Harriet, “ all preaching 
the doctrine of snatch I agree that they left me with the feehng that none 
of the characters knew what they wanted ” 

“ No,” said Miss de Vine If you are once sure what you do want, 
you find that everything else goes down before it like grass under a roller 
— all other interests, your own and other people’s Miss Lydgate wouldn’t 
like my saying that, but it’s as true of her as of anybody else She’s the 
kindest soul in the world, in things she’s indifferent about, like the 
peculations of Jukes But she hasn’t the slightest mercy on the prosodical 
theories of Mr Elkbottom She wouldn’t coimtenance those to save Mr 
Elkbottom fiom hanging She’d say she couldn’t And she couldn’t, of 
course If she actually sao) Mr Elkbottom wnthmg m humiliation, she’d 
be sorry, but she wouldn’t alter a paragraph That would be treason 
One can’t be pitiful where one’s own job is concerned You’d he 
cheerfully, I expect, about anytlimg except— what ^ ” 

Oh, anything * ” said Harriet, laughing “ Except saying that some- 
body’s beastly book is good when it isn’t I can’t do that It makes me a 
lot of enemies, but I can’t do it ” 

“ No, one can’t,” said Miss de Vine “ However painful it is, there’s 
always one thing one has to deal with sincerely, if there’s any root to one’s 
mind at all I ought to know, from my own experience Of course, the 
one thing may be an emotional thing , I don’t say it mayn’t One may 
commit all the sms m the calendar, and still be faithful and honest 
towards one person If so, then that one person is probably one’s ap- 
pointed job I’m not despising that kind of loyalty , it doesn’t happen 
to be mine, that is all ” 


*35 



** Did you discover that by making a fundamental mistake ^ ” asked 
Harriet, a little nervously 

“ Yes,” said Miss de Vine ** I once got engaged to somebody But I 
found I was always blundering — ^hurting his feelings, doing stupid things, 
making quite elementary mistakes about him In the end I realised that 
I simply wasn’t taking as much trouble with him as I should have done 
over a disputed reading So I decided he wasn’t my job ” She smiled 
“ For all that, I was fonder of him than he was of me He married an 
excellent woman who is devoted to him and does make him her job I 
should think he was a full-time job He is a painter and usually on the 
verge of bankruptcy , but he paints very well ” 

** I suppose one oughtn’t to mairy anybody, unless one’s prepared to 
make him a full-time job ” 

“ Probably not , though there are a few rare people, I believe, who 
don’t look on themselves as jobs but as fellow-creatures 

“ I should think Phoebe Tucker and her husband were like that,” 
said Harriet “You met her at the Gaudy That collaboration seems to 
work But what with the wives who are jealous of their husbands’ work 
and the husbands who are jealous of their wives’ interests, it looks as 
though most of us imagined ourselves to be jobs ” 

“ The worst of being a job,” said Miss de Vine, “ is the devastating 
effect It has on one’s character I’m very sorry for the person who is 
somebody else’s job , he (or she, of course) ends by devouring or being 
devoured, either of which is bad for one My painter has devoured his 
wife, though neither of them knows it , and poor Miss Cattermole is in 
great danger of being identified with her parents* job and being 
devoured ” 

“ Then you’re all for the impersonal job ^ ” 

“ I am,” said Miss de Vine 

“ But you say you don’t despise those who make some other person 
their job ^ ” 

“ Far from despising them,” said Miss de Vine , “ I think they are 
dangerous ” 


Christ Church, 
Friday 

Dear Miss Vane, 

If you can forgive my idiotic behaviour the other day, will you come 
and lunch with me on Monday at i o’clock ^ Please do I am still 
feeling suiadal, so it would really be a work of charity all round I 
hope the menngues got home safely 


Very sincerely yours, 

Saint-George 


* 3 ^ 



My dear young man, thought Harriet, as she wrote an acceptance of 
this naive invitation, if you think I can’t see through that, you’re 
mightily mistaken Tins is not for me, but for les beatixyeux de la cassette de 
I* oncle Pierre But there are worse meals than those that come out of the 
House kitchen, and I will go I should like to know how much money 
you’re managing to get through, by the way The heir of Denver should 
be rich enough in his own right without appealing to Uncle Peter 
Gracious * when I think that I was given my college fees and my clothes 
and five pounds a term to make whoopee on * You won’t get much 
sympathy or support from me, my lord 


Still in this severe mood, she drove down St Aldate’s on Monday and 
inquired of the porter beneatli Tom Tower for Lord Saint-George , only 
to be told that Lord Samt-George was not in College 
“ Oh • ” said Harriet, disconcerted, “ but he asked me to lunch ” 

“ What a pity you weren’t let know, miss Lord Samt-George was in 
a nasty motor-accident on Friday mght He’s in tlie Infirmary Didn’t 
you see it in the papers ^ ” 

“ No, I missed it Is he badly hurt ^ ” 

“ Injured his shoulder and cut his head open pretty badly, so we hear,” 
said the porter, with regret, and yet with a slight relish at the imparting 
of bad news “ ^le was unconscious for twenty-four hours , but we are 
informed that his condition is now improvmg The Duke and Duchess 
have left for the country again ” 

“ Dear me ^ ” said Harnet ** I’m very sorry to hear this I’d better go 
round and inquire Do you know whether he is allowed to see anybody 
yet ^ ” 

The porter looked her over with a paternal eye, which somehow 
suggested to her that if she had been an imdergraduate the answer would 
have been No 

“ I believe, miss,” said the porter, that Mr Danvers and Lord 
Warboys were permitted to visit his lordship this mormng I couldn’t 
say further than that Excuse me — there is Mr Danvers just crossmg the 
quadrangle I will ascertain ” 

He emerged from his glass case and pursued Mr Danvers, who 
immediately came runnmg to the lodge 
“ I say,” said Mr Danvers, are you Miss Vane ^ Because poor old 
Samt-George has only just remembered about you He’s tcmbly sorry, 
and I was to catch you and give you some grub No trouble at all — a 
great pleasure We ought to have let you know, but he was knocked dean 
out, poor old chap And then, what with the family fussing round— do 
you know the Duchess No Ah * Well, she went off this mormng, 
and then I was allowed to go round and got my instructions Terrific 
apologies and all that ”

“ How did It happen ^ ” 

“ Driving a racing car to the danger of the pubhc,** said Mr Danvers, 
with a grimace. “ Trying to make it before the gates were shut No police 
on the spot, as it happened, so we don’t know exactly what did happen 
Nobody killed, fortunately Saint-George took a telegraph-pole in his 
stride, apparently, went out head first and pitched on his shoulder 
Lucky he had the windscreen down, or he’d have had no face to speak 
of The car’s a total wreck, and I don’t know why he isn’t But all those 
Wimseys have as many hves as cats Come along in These are my rooms 
I hope you can eat the usual lamb cutlets — there wasn’t tune to think up 
anvthmg special But I had particular orders to hunt out Samt-George s 
Niersteiner *23 and mention Uncle Peter m connection with it Is that 
right ^ I don’t know whether Uncle Peter bought it or recommended it 
or merely enjoyed it, or what he had to do with it, but that’s what I was 
told to say ” 

Harriet laughed “ If he did any of those things, it’ll be all right ” 

The Niersteiner was excellent, and Harriet heartlessly enjoyed her 
lunch, finding Mr Danvers a pleasant host 

“ And do go up and see the patient,” said Mr Danvers, as he escorted 
her at length to the gate “ He’s quite fit to receive company, and it’ll 
cheer him up no end He’s in a private ward, so you can get in any time ” 

** I’ll go straight away,” said Harriet 

“ Do,” said Mr Danvers ” What’s that ^ ” he added, turmng to the 
porter, who had come out with a letter in his hand “ Oh, something for 
Saint-George Right Yes I expect the lady will take it up, if she’s going 
now If not, it can wait for the messenger ” 

Harriet looked at the superscnption “ The Viscount Saint-George, 
Christ Church, Oxford, Inghilterra ” Even without the Italian stamp, 
there was no mistaking where that came from “I’ll take it,” she said — 
“ It might be urgent ” 

Lord Saint-George, with his right arm in a slmg, his forehead and one 
eye obscured by bandages and the other eye black and bloodshot, was 
profuse in welcome and apology 

“ I hope Danvers looked after you all nght It’s frightfully decent of 
you to come along ” 

Harriet asked if he was badly hurt 

“ Well, It might be worse I fancy Uncle Peter had a near squeak of 
it this time, but it’s worked out at a cut head and a busted shoulder And 
shock and bruises and all that Much less than I deserve Stay and talk 
to me It’s dashed dull being all alone, and I’ve only got. one eye and 
can’t see out of that ” 

” Won’t talking make your head ache ^ ” 

“ It can’t ache worse than it does already And you’ve got a mce voice 
Do be kind and stay ” 

138 



“ I\e brought a letter along for you from College ” 

“ Some dashed dun or other, I suppose ** 

No It*s from Rome ” 

“ Uncle Peter Oh, my God • I suppose Pd better know the worst ** 
She put It into his left hand, and watched his fingers fumble across the 
bioad red seal 

“Ugh * Seaiing-wax and the family crest I know what that means 
Uncle Peter at his stuffiest ” 

He struggled impatiently with the tough envelope 
“ Shall I open it for you ^ ’* 

“ I wish you would And, look here — ^be an angel and read it to me. 
Even with two good eyes, his fist’s a bit of a strain ” 

Harriet drew out the letter and glanced at the opemng words 
“ This looks rather private ” 

“ Better you than the nurse. Besides, I can bear it better wnth a spot 
of womanly sympathy I say, is there any enclosure ^ ” 

“ No enclosure No ** 

The patient groaned 

“ Uncle Peter turns to bay That’s tom it How does it start ? If it’s 
‘ Gherkins ’ or * Jerry,’ or even * Gerald,* there’s hope yet ” 

“ It starts, ‘ My dear Samt-George * ” 

“ Oh gosh ’ Then he’s really furious And signed with all the initials 
he can rake up, what ^ ” 

Hamet turned the letter over 
“ Signed with all his names in full ’* 

“ Unrelenting monster * You know, I had a sort of feeling he wouldn^t 
fake It very well I don’t know what the devil I’m gomg to do now ” 

He looked so ill that Hamet said, rather anxiously * 

“ Hadn’t we better leave it till to-morrow ^ ” 

“ No I must know where I stand Carry on Speak gently to your little 
boy Sing it to me It’ll need it ” 

My dear Samt-George, 

If I have rightly understood your rather mcoherent statement of 
your affairs, you have contracted a debt of honour for a sum which you 
do not possess You have settled it with a cheque which you had no 
money to meet As cover for this, you have borrowed from a finend, 
giving him a post-dated cheque which you have no reason to suppose 
will be met either You suggest that I should accommodate you by 
backing your bill at six months , failing which, you will either (a) 
“ try Levy again,” or (b) blow your brains out The former alternative 
woiild, as you admit, increase your ultimate liability , the second, as 
I will myself venture to point out, would not reimburse your friend 
but merely add disgrace to insolvency 


*39 



Lord Samt-George shifted restlessly upon his pillows Nasty clear- 
headed way he has of putting things ** 

You are good enough to say that you approach me rather than your 
father, because I am, in your opimon, more likely to be sympathetic 
to this dubious piece of finance I cannot say I feel flattered by your 
opinion 

“ I didn’t mean that, exactly,” groaned the viscount “ He knows 
quite well what I mean The Governor would fly nght off the handle 
Damn it, it’s his own fault ’ He oughtn’t to keep me so short What does 
he expect ^ Considering the money he got through in his giddy youth, he 
should know something about it And Uncle Peter’s rolling— it wouldn’t 
hurt him to cough up a bit ” 

“ I don’t think it’s the money so much as the dud cheques, is it ^ ” 

“ That’s the trouble Well, why the devil does he go barging off to 
Rome just when he’s wanted ^ He knows I wouldn’t have given a dud if 
I could have got cover for it But I couldn’t get at him if he wasn’t there 
Well, read on Let’s hear the worst 

I am quite aware that your premature decease would leave me 
heir-presumptive to the tide — 

” Heir-presumptive ^ Oh, I see My mother might peg out and 
my father marry again Calculating brute ” 

— ^heir-presumptive to the tide and estate. Tedious as such an mhen- 
tance might be, you will forgive me for suggesting that I might prove 
a more honest steward than yourself 

“ Hell ! That’s one in the eye,” said the viscount “ If that line of 
defence has gone, it’s all up ” 

You remind me that when you attain your majority next July, you 
will receive an increased allowance Since, however, even the sum you 
have mentioned amounts to about a year’s mcome on the higher scale 
of payment, your prospect of redeeming your bill in six months’ time 
seems to be remote , nor do I imderstand what you propose to live on 
when you have anticipated your income to this extent Further, I do 
not for one moment suppose that the sum in question represents die 
whole of your liabilities 

“ Damned thought-reader > ” growled his lordship ** Of course it 
doesn’t But how does he know ^ ” 

In the circumstances, I must dechne to back your bill or to lend 
you money 

“ Well, that’s flat Why didn’t he say so at once ^ ” 

140 



Since, however, you have put your name to a cheque, and that name 
must not be dishonoured, I have instructed my bankers — 

“ Gome * that sounds a bit better Good old Uncle Peter • You can 
always get him on the family name ” 

— ^instructed my bankers to arrange to cover your cheques — 

** Cheque, or cheques ^ ” 

** Cheques, in the plural , quite distinctly 

— cover your cheques from now until the time of my return to England, 
when I shall come and see you This will probably be before the end 
of the Trinity Term I will ask you to see to it that the whole of your 
liabilities are discharged by that time, mcluding your outstanding 
Oxford debts and your obligations to the children of Israel 

First gleam of humanity,*’ said the viscount 

May I offer you, in addition, a little advice ^ Bear in mind that the 
amateur professional is peculiarly rapacious ThiS applies both to 
women and to people who play cards If you must back horses, back 
them at a reasonable pnce and both ways And, if you insist on 
blowing out your brains, do it m some place where you will not cause 
mess and mconvemence 

Your affectionate Uncle, 

Peter Death Bredon Wimsey 

“ Whew * ” said Lord Samt-George, that’s a stinker ’ I fancy I 
detect a little softemng in the last paragraph Otherwise, I should say 
that a nastier kind of letter never came to soothe the sufferer’s aching 
brow What do you think ^ ” 

Harriet privately agreed that it was not the kind of letter she should 
care to receive It displayed, m fact, almost everything that she resented 
most in Peter , the condescending superiority, the arrogance of caste and 
the generosity that was like a blow in the face However — 

“ He’s done far more than you asked hun,” she pointed out “ So far as 
I can see, there’s nothing to prevent you from drawing a cheque for 
fifty thousand and blueing the lot ” 

“ That’s the devil of it He’s got me by the short hairs He’s trusted me 
with the whole dashed outfit I did think he might offer to settle up for 
me, but he’s left me to do it and hasn’t even asked for an account That 
means it’ll have to be done I don’t see how I can get out of it He has 
the most ingenious ways of making a fellow feel a sweep Oh, hell ^ my 
head’s splitting ” 

** You’d better keep qmet and try to go to sleep You’ve nothing to 
worry about now ” 

No Wait a minute Don’t go away The cheque’s all right, that’s 

141 



the chief thing Just as weUj because Fd have had a job to raise the M-ind 
ehewhere, laid up like this There’s one thing about it — I can’t use this 
arm, so I shan’t have to wnte a long screed full of grateful penitence ” 

“ Does he Know about your accident ^ ” 

“ Not unless A.unt Mary’s written to ium My Grand motlier’s on the 
Ri\nera, and I don’t suppose it would occur to my sister She’s at school 
The Governor never writes to anybody, and my Mother certainly 
wouldn’t bother with Uncle Peter Look here, I must do something I 
mean, the old boy’s been thoroughly decent, really Couldn’t you write 
a line for me, expiaimng all about it ? I don’t want to let my family in on 
this ” 

1 11 do that, certainly ” 

“ Tell him I’ll settle the blasted debts as soon as I can produce a 
recognisable signature I say • think of having a free hand with Uncle 
Peter’s pile and not being able to sign a cheque Enough to make a cat 
laugh, isn’t it ^ Say I — ^what’s the phrase ^ — appreciate his confidence 
and won’t let him down Here ’ you might give me a spot of the stuff in 
that jug, would you ^ I feel like Dives in what’s-his-name ” 

He gulped the iced drink down gratefully 

“ No, damn it * I must do something The old boy’s really worried I 
think I can work these fingers after a fashion Find me a pencil and paper 
and I’ll have a shot ” 

“ I don’t think you’d better ” 

“ Yes, I had better And I will if it kills me Find me something, there’s 
a darling ” 

She found writmg matenals, and held the paper in place while he 
scrawled a few staggenng words The pain made him sweat , a shoulder 
joint which has been dislocated and returned to position is no cushion of 
ease the day after , but he set his teeth and went through with it gamely 

“ There,” he said, wuth a faint grin, “ that looks dashed pathetic Now 
it’s up to you Do your best for me, won’t you ^ ” 


Perhaps, thought Harriet, Peter knew the right way with his nephew 
The boy was unblushingly ready to consider other people’s money his 
own , and probably, if Peter had simply backed his bill, he would have 
thought his uncle easy game and proceeded to issue more paper on the 
same terms As it was, he seemed inclmed to stop and think And he had, 
what she herself lacked, the grace of gratitude His facile acceptance of 
favours might be a sign of shallowness , still, it had cost him something to 
scnbble that pamful note 

It was only when, in her own room after Hall, she set about writing to 
Peter, that she realised how awkward her own teisk was going to be To 
142 



put down a brief explanation of her own acquaintance with Lord Saint- 
George and a reassunng account of his accident v/as child’s play The 
difficulties began with the matter of the young man’s finances Her first 
draft ran easily it was shghiiy humorous and rather ga\ e tne benefactor 
to understand that lus precious balms were calculated to break the re- 
cipient’s head, where other agents had not already broken it She rather 
enjoyed WTitmg this one On reading it over, she was disappointed to 
find that it had an air of officious impertinence She tore it up 
The students were making a vast noise of trampling and laughter m 
the corridor Harriet briefly cursed them and tried again 
The second draft began stiffiy “ Dear Peter — I am wntmg on behalf 

of your nephew, who has unfortunately ” 

This one, when finished, conveved the impression that she disapproved 
strongly of uncle and nephew alike, and was anxious to dissociate herself 
as far as possible from their affairs 
She tore it up, cursed the students again and made a third draft 
This, when completed, turned out to be a moving, and, indeed, 
powerful piece of special pleading on the young sinner’s behalf, but 
contained remarkably little of the gratitude and repentance which she 
had been instructed to convey The fourth draft, erring m the opposite 
direction, was merely fulsome 

“ What the devil is the matter with me ^ ” she said aloud “ (Damn 
those noisy brats *) Why can’t I vmte a straightforw^ard piece of English 
on a set subject ^ ” 

When she had once formulated the difficulty in this plain question, 
the detached mteliect bent meekly to its acadenuc task and produced the 
answer 

“Because, however you put it, all this is going to hurt his pride 
damnably ” 

Answer adjudged correct 

What she had to say, stripped of its verbiage, was Your nephew has 
been behaving foolishly and dishonestly, and I know^ it , he gets on badly 
with his parents, and I know that, too , he has taJken me into his con- 
fidence and, what is more, into yours, where I have no right to be , m 
fact, I know a great many things you w^ould rather I did not know, and 
you can’t hft a hand to prevent it 

In fact, for the first time in their acquamtance, she had the upper hand 
of Peter Wimsey, and could rub his aristocratic nose m the dirt if she 
wanted to Since she had been looking for such an opportunity for five 
years, it would be odd if she did not hasten to take advantage of it 
Slowly and with extreme pains, she started on Draft No 5. 

Dear Peter, 

I don’t knowwhetlier you know that your nephew is m the Infirmary, 
recovering from what might have been a nasty motor accident. His 

^48 



nght shoulder is dislocated and his head badly cut , but he is getting 
on all right and is lucky not to have been killed Apparently he 
skidded into a telegraph pole I don’t know the details , perhaps you 
have aiieady heard from Ins people I met him by chance a few days 
ago, and only heard of the accident to-day, ivhen I went round to see 
him 

So far, so good , now for the awkward bit 

One of his eyes was bandaged up and the other badly swollen, so he 
asked me to read him a letter he had just that moment received from 
you (Please don’t think his sight is damaged — I asked the nurse, and 
It’s only cuts and bruises ) There was nobody else to read it to him, as 
his parents left Oxford this morning As he can’t wnte much himself, 
he asks me to send you the enclosed and to say he thanks you very 
much and is sorry He appreciates your confidence and will do exactly 
as you asL him, as soon as he is well enough 

She hoped there was nothing there that could offend She had 
started to wnte “ honourably do as you ask,” and then erased the first 
word to mention honour was to suggest its opposite Her consciousness 
seemed to have become all one exposed nerve-centre, sensitive to the 
lightest breath of innuendo m her own words 

I didn’t stay long, as he was really a good bit under the weather, 
but they assure me he is doing very well He insisted on writing this 
note himself, though I suppose I oughtn’t to have let him I’ll look him 
up again before I leave Oxford — entirely for my own sake, because he 
IS perfectly charming I hope you don’t mmd my saying so, though 
I’m sure you don’t need to be told it 

Yours, 

Harriet D Vane 

I seem to be taking a lot of trouble about this, she thought, as she 
carefully re-read it If I beheved Miss de Vme, I might begin to imagine 
— damn those students » — ^Would anybody beheve it could take one two 
hours to wnte a simple letter ^ 

She put the letter resolutely mto an envelope, and addressed and 
stamped it Nobody, having put on a twopenny-halfpenny stamp, was 
ever known to open the envelope agam That was done For a couple of 
hours now she would devote herself to the affairs of Shendan Lefanu 


She worked away happily till half-past ten , the racket in the passage 
calmed down , words flowed smoothly From tune to time, she looked 
up from her paper, hesitating for a word, and saw through the window 
the lights of Burleigh and Queen Elizabeth burning back across the quad, 
counterparts of her own Many of them, no doubt, illumined cheerful 

144 



parties, like the one m the Annexe , others lent their aid to people who, 
like herself, were engaged m the elusive pursuit of knowledge, covering 
paper with ink and hesitating now and again over a word She felt her- 
self to be a living part of a community engaged in a common purpose 
“ Wilkie Collins,*’ wrote Harriet, “ was always handicapped in his 
treatment of the supernatural by the fatal itch ” (could one be handi- 
capped by an itch ^ Yes, why not Let it go, anyway, for the moment) 

“ the fatal itch to explain everything His legal training ” Bother ’ 

Too long was handicapped by the lawyer’s fatal habit of 

explaining everything His ghaisties and ghouhes ” — No , worn-out 

humour “ His dream-phantasms and appaiitions are too careful to 

tuck their shrouds neatly about them and leave no loose ends to trouble 
us It IS m Lefanu that we fmd the natural maker of— natural master of 
— the master of the uncanny whose mastery comes by nature If we 
compare ” 

Before the comparison could be instituted, the lamp v^ent suddenly 
out 

“ Curse * ” said Harriet She rose and pressed dowm the w'all-switch 
Nothing happened “ Fused * ” said Harriet, opemng the door to investi- 
gate The corridor was in daikness, and a lamentable outcry on either 
side proclaimed that the lights were out in the whole of Tudor 

Harriet snatched her torch from the table and turned right towards 
the mam block of the building She was soon swept into a crowd of 
students, some with torches and some clinging to those that had them, 
all clamouring and wanting to know'' what was wrong with the lights 

“ Shut up ’ ” said Harriet, peenng behind the barrier of the torch- 
lights to find anybody she recogmsed “ The mam fuse must have gone 
Where’s the fuse-box ^ ” 

“ I think It’s under the stairs,” said somebody 
Stay where you are,” said Hamet “ I’ll go and see ” 

Nobody, naturally, stayed where she was Everybody came helpfully 
and angrily dowmstairs. 

“ It’s the Poltergeist,” said somebody 
Let’s catch her this time,” said somebody else 

“ Perhaps it’s only blown,” suggested a timid voice out of the darkness 

** Blown be blowed ^ ” exclaimed a louder voice, scornfully “ How 
often does a mam fuse blow ^ ” Then, m an agitated whisper, “ Heliup, 
It’s the Chilperic Sorry I spoke 

“ Is that you. Miss Chilpenc ^ ” said Harriet, glad to round up one 
member of the Semor Common Room “ Have you met Miss Barton 
anywhere ^ ” 

** No, I’ve only just got out of bed ” 

“ Miss Barton isn’t there,” said a voice from the hall below, and then 
another voice chimed in 

“ Somebody’s pulled out the main fuse and taken it away ^ ” 


145 



And then, m a shrill cry from someone at the end of the lower corridor 
** There she goes ^ Look * running^ across the quad ^ 

Harriet was earned down the stairs with a rush of twenty or thirty 
students into the midst of those already milling in the hall There was a 
cram in tne doorway She lost Miss Chilpenc and was left behind m the 
struggle Then, as she thrust her way througn on to tiie terrace, she saw 
under the dim sky a stnng of runners stretched across the quad Voices 
were calling shrilly Then, as the first half-dozen or so of the pursuers 
were outlined against the blazing lower windows of Burleigh, those lights 
too were biackea out 

She ran, desperately— not to Burleigh where the uproar was repeating 
itself, but to Queen Ehzabeth, which, she judged, would be the next 
point of attack The side-doors would, she knew, be locked She dashed 
past the hall stair and through to the portico, where she flung herself 
upon the mam door That was locked also She stepped back and shouted 
through the nearest window Look out * There’s somebody in here 
playing tricks I’m coming m ” A student put out a tousled head Other 
heads appeared “ Let me get past,” said Harriet, flinging the sash up, 
and hauling herself up over the sill “ They’re putting out all the lights in 
College Where’s your fuse-box ^ ’ 

“ Pm sure I don’t know,” said the student, as Harriet plunged across 
the room 

‘‘ Of course you wouldn’t * ” said Harriet, unreasonably She flung 
the door open and burst out — mto Stygian blackness By this time the 
hue-and-cry outside had reached Queen Ehzabeth Somebody found the 
front door and unlocked it, and the tumult increased, those within 
surging out and those outside surging m A voice said Somebody came 
through my room and went out of the window, just after the lights w^ent 
out ” Torches appeared Here and there a face — mostly unfamiliar — was 
momentarily ht up Then the hghts in the New Quad began to go out 
also, begmmng on the South side Everybody was runnmg aimlessly 
Harriet, dashing along the phnth, cannoned full tilt into somebody and 
flashed the toren m her face It was the Dean 

“ Thank God ’ ” said Harriet " Here’s somebody in the right place ” 
She held on to her, 

** What’s happemng ^ ” sa^d the Dean 

“ Stand still,” said Harriet “ I’ll have an ahbi for you if I die for it ” 
As she spoke, the hghts on the North-East angle went out “ You’re all 
nght,” said Harriet ** Now then * make for the West Staircase and we’ll 
catch her ” 

The same idea seemed to have occurred to a number of other people, 
for the entrance to the West Staircase was blocked with a crowd of 
students, v^hile a crowd of scouts, released by Came from their own 
Wmg, added to the congestion Harriet and the Dean forced a pathway 
through them, and foimd Miss Lydgate standing be%vildered, and clasp- 
145 



mg her proof-sheets to ner bosom, being determined that this time 
nothing should happen to them They scooped her up with them — “ like 
playing ‘ Staggie ’ ** thought Haniet — and made their way to the fuse* 
boxes under the stairs There they found Padgett, grimlv on guard, vxih 
his trousers hastily pulled on over ms pyjamas and a rolimg-pin in his 
hand 

“ They don’t get this,” said Padgett " You leav'e it to me, madam 
Dean, miss Just turning into my bed, I was, all the latc-leave ladies 
being in My wife’s telephoning across to Jackson to fetch over some new 
fuses Have you seen the boxes, miss ’> Wrenched open with a chisel, they 
was, or summat of that A mce thing to happen But they w^on’t get this ” 

Nor did “ they ” In the West side of the New Quad, the Wai den’s 
House, the Infirmary, and the Scouts’ Wing entrenched behind it’s 
reiocked grille, the lights burned on steadily But wdien Jackson arrived 
with the new fuses, every daikened building showed its trail of damage 
While Padgett had sat by the mouse-hole, waiting for the mouse that did 
not come, the Polteigeist had passed through the college, breaking ink- 
bottles, flinging papers into the Are smashing lamps and ciockerv and 
throwing books through the window-panes In the Hah, where the main 
fuse had also been taken, the silver cups on the High Table had been 
hurled at the portraits, breaking the glass, and the plaster bust of a 
Victonan benefactor pitched down the stone sta^r, to end in a fragmen- 
tary trail of detached side-whiskers and disintegrated features 

Well ! ” said the Dean, surveying the w^reckage “ That’s one thing 
to be grateful for We’ve seen the last of the Reverend Melchisedek 
Entwistle But, oh, lord f ”

WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE 

It would seem, at first sight, as though, m an episode witnessed by so 
many people and lasting altogether about an hour (counting, that is, 
from the first alarm m Tudor to the refitting of the final fuse) it should 
have been easy to find alibis for all the innocent In practice, it was 
not so at all, chiefly owing to tiie stubborn refusal of human bemgs to 
stay where they are put It was the very multiplicity of witnesses that 
made the difficulty , for it seemed likely that the culprit had mixed with 

14^ 



the crowd over and over again in the dark Some alibis were established 
for certain Harriet and the Dean had been standing together when the 
lights were extinguished on the North-east angle of the New Quad , the 
Warden had not left her own house till after the uproar had started, as 
her household staff could attest , the two porters were vouched for by 
their respective wives, and had, in fact, never been suspected, since on 
various earlier occasions disturbances had occurred while they were at 
their posts , the Infirmaiian and the Infirmary maid had also been 
together the whole time Miss Hudson, the student who had been con- 
sidered a “ possible,” had been at a coffee-party when the trouble began, 
and was clear , Miss Lydgate also, to Harriet’s great relief, had been in 
Queen Elizabeth, enjoying the hospitality of a party of Third Years , she 
had just risen to say good mght, remarking that it was past her usual 
time, when the lights had gone out She had then been caught up in the 
throng and, as soon as she could free herself, had run hastily up to her 
own room to rescue her proofs 

Other members of the SCR were less fortunately placed The case 
of Miss Barton was excitmg and mysterious According to her own 
account, she had been sitting workmg when the fuse was pulled out in 
Tudor After trying the wall-switch, she had looked out of the window, 
seen the figure hastemng across the quad, and gone immediately m 
pursuit The figure had dodged her round Burleigh twice, and had then 
suddenly come upon her from behmd, flung her against the wall “ with 
extraordmary strength ” and knocked her torch from her hand Before 
she could recover herself, the evil-doer had extinguished the Burleigh 
hghts and gone agam Miss Barton could give no description of this 
person, except that it wore something dark ” and ran very fast She 
had not seen its face The only proof of this story was that Miss Barton 
certainly had received a heavy bruise on the side of the face where, so 
she said, she had been flimg against an angle of the buildmg She had 
remained where she lay for a few minutes after receiving the blow , by 
that time the excitement had spread to the New Quad Here she had 
certainly been seen for a few seconds together by a pair of students She 
had then run to look for the Dean, found her room empty, run out again 
and jomed Harriet and the rest m the West Staircase 

Miss Chilpenc’s stoiy was equally difficult of proof When the cry of 
** There she goes * ” had been raised at Tudor, she had been among the 
first to run out, but, havmg no torch, and bemg too much excited to 
notice where she was going, she had tripped and fallen down the steps 
of the terrace, twistmg her foot slightly This had made her late in 
amvmg on the scene She had come up with the crowd at Queen 
Elizabeth, been earned m with it through the portico and run straight 
into the New Quadrangle Buildmgs She had thought she heard footsteps 
scurrying along to her nght, and had followed them, when the hghts had 
gone out and, not knowing the buildmg at all well, she had wandered 
S48 



about in some confusion, till at last she found the way out into the quad 
Nobody seemed able to lemember seeing Miss Ghilperic at all after s^c 
left Tudor , she was that kind of person 

The Treasurer had been sitting up at work on the term’s accounts 
The lights in her building had been the last to go out, and her windows 
looked outward upon the road and not upon the quad, so that she had 
known nothing about the affair till a late stage m the proceedings When 
the darkness fell on her she went (so she said) to the Bursar’s set opposite, 
electrical replacements being m the Bursar's department The Bursar 
was not in her bedroom or office , but as IVliss Allison came out from 
looking for her, she emeiged from the place where the fuse-boxes were, 
to announce the disappearance of the mam fuse Treasurer and Bursar 
had then joined the crowed in the quadrangle 

The account given by Miss Pyke of her mo'vemenls seemed to be the 
most incredible of all She lived above the Treasurer and had been 
working at an article for a learned Society’s transactions When her 
lights had gone out, she had said, “ Bother * ”, taken a pair of candles 
from a stock which she kept for such emergencies, and gone quietly on 
working 

Miss Burrows asserted that she had been having a bath when the 
Burleigh Building Lights failed, and, by an extraordinary coincidence, 
had found, on getting hastily out of it, that she nad left her towel in her 
bedroom She did not possess a self-contained set with a private bathroom 
and so was obhged to grope, with her dressing-gown clutched about her 
dnpping body, along the passage to her bedroom, and there dry and 
dress herself in the dark This had taken a surprisingly long time and, 
when she came up with the mam party, most of the fun was over No 
proof, except the imdoubted presence of soapy water m a bathroom on 
her floor 

Miss Shaw’s set was over the Bursar’s, and her bedroom looked out on 
St Cross Road She had gone to bed and to sleep, being very tired, and 
knew nothing about it till it was all over The same story was told by 
Mrs Goodwin, who had returned to College only that day, rather 
exhausted by sick-nursmg As for Miss Hilly ard and Miss de Vine, living 
above Miss Lydgate , their lights had never gone out at all, and, their 
windows facing on the road, they had never knowm that anything was 
wrong, puttmg down a vague noise in the quad to the natural cussedness 
of undergraduates 

It had only been after Padgett had sat for about flve nunutes m vain 
at the mouse-hole, that Kamet had done what she should have done 
earher, and attempted to make a count of the Semor Common Room 
She had then found them all m the places where, by their subsequent 
accounts of themselves, they should have been But to collect them all 
into one hghted room and keep them there was not so easy She estab- 
lished Miss Lydgate in her own room and went to look for the rest, asking 

149 



them to go straight down to Miss Lydgate’s room and stay there The 
Warden, meanwhile, had arrived and was addressing the students, 
implonng them also to stay where they were and keep quiet Unfortu- 
nately, just as It began to seem possible to make sure of everybody’s 
whereabouts, some inquisitive person, who had broken away from the 
rest and gone roaming through the Old Quad, arrived, breathless, to 
announce the tale of damage in the Hall Instantly, pandemonium 
broke loose again Dons who were trotting like lambs into the sheep-fold 
suddenly lost their heads and raced with the students into the darkness 
Miss Burrows screamed “ The Library * ” and tore away, and the 
Bursar, with an anguished cry for the College property, dashed after her 
The Dean called, ** Stop them * ” and Miss Pyke and Miss HiUyard, 
taking the command to themselves, rushed out and disappeared In the 
resulting conflision, everybody got lost twenty times over , and by the 
time the fuses were replaced and the community at last gathered and 
numbered, the damage had all been done 

• • • 

It is surprising how much can be done m a very few minutes Harnet 
calculated that the Hall had probably been wrecked first of all, being m 
a detached wing, where noise was not likely to attract much attention , 
ail that was done there could have been done m a couple of minutes 
From the extinguishing of the first lights m Tudor to that of the last 
lights m the New Quad, rather less than ten minutes had elapsed The 
third, and longest part of the business — the wrecking of the rooms in the 
darkened buildmgs, had taken anythmg from a quarter to half an hour. 


The Warden addressed the College after Chapel, again enjoming 
discretion, begging the ctdpnt to come forward, and promising that all 
possible measures should be taken to identify her in case she did not 
confess 

I have no intention,’’ said Dr Barmg, of inflicting any restriction 
or pumshment upon the college m general for the act of one irresponsible 
person I will ask any one who has any suggestion to make or any 
evidence to offer with regard to the identity of this foolish practical 
joker to come pnvately, either to the Dean or myself, and make the 
communication m strict confidence ” 

She added a few words about the solidarity of the College and departed 
with a grave face, her gown floatmg behind her 
The glaziers were already at work restonng damaged wmdow-panes 
In the Hall, the Bursar was a&cing neat car^ in the places of portraits 
whose glass had been broken ** Portrait of Miss Matheson Warden 
1899*1912 Removed for cleaning ” Broken crockery was bemg swept 
from the grass of the Old Quad The College was engaged in presenting 
a serene face to the world

It did not improve anybody’s temper to discover a printed message, 
consisting of “ HA ♦ HA * ” and a vulgar epitbe^-, pasted across tne 
mirror in the Semor Common Room, shortly before lunch The Common 
Room had oeen empty from 9 o’clock onwards so far as was known The 
Common Room maid, gomg in at lunch-time with the coSee-cups, had 
been the first to see the notice ; and it had bv then dried hard The 
Bursar, who had missed her pot of Cloy after the night’s excitement, 
found It placed neatly in the centre of the SCR mantelpiece 


The feeling m the Senior Common Room after this episode underwent 
a subtle alteration Tongues were sharpened , the veneer of detachment 
began to wear thin , the uneasiness of suspicion began to make itself 
felt , only Miss Lydgate and the Dean, being proved innocent, 1 emamed 
unmoved 


“ Your bad luck seems to have repeated itself, Miss Barton,” observed 
Miss Pyke, acidly, ** Both in the Library affair and in tins last outbreak, 
you seem to have been first on the spot and yet unhappily prevented 
from securing the culpnt ” 

Yes,” said Miss Barton It’s very unfoitunatc If next time my gown 
gets taken as well, the College sleuth will begin to smell a rat ” 

Very trying for you, Mrs Goodwin,” said J^liss HiUyard, to come 
back to all this upset, just when you needed a rest I trust your little boy 
IS better It is particularly tiresome, because all the time you were away 
we had no disturbance at all ” 

“ It’s most annoying,” said Mrs Goodwm “ The poor creature who 
does these things must be quite demented Of course these disorders do 
tend to occur in cehbate, or chiefly celibate commumties It is a kind of 
compensation, I suppose, for the lack of other excitements ” 

** The great mistake,” said Miss Burrows, “ was, of course, our not 
keeping together Naturally I wanted to see if any damage had been 
done in the Library — ^but why so many people should have come pelting 
after me ” 

“ The Hall was my concern,” said the Bursar 

“ Oh * you dzd get to the Hail ? I completely lost sight of you in the 
quad ” 

That,” said Miss Hillyard, ** was exactly the catastrophe I was 
trying to avoid when I pursued you I called loudly to you to stop You 
must have heard me ” 

“ There was too much noise to hear anything,” said Miss Stevens 

“ I came to Miss Lydgate’s room,” said Miss Shaw, ** the moment I 

151 



couid get dressed, understanding that everybody was to be there But 
there was really nobody I thought I must have misunderstood, so I 
tried to find Miss Vane, but she seemed to have gone off into the 
Ewigkeit ** 

“ It must have taken you a remaikably long time to dress,” said Miss 
Bunows ‘‘ Anybody could run three times round College in the time it 
takes you to pull >our stocbngs on ” 

“ Somebody,” said Iviiss Shaw, “ apparently dtd ” 


“ They’re begmmng to get fractious,” said Harriet to the Dean 
“ What can you expect ^ The silly cuckoos ’ If they’d only sat tight on 
their little behinds last night, we could have cleared the whole business 
up It’s not your fault You couldn’t be everywhere at once How we can 
expect discipline from the students, when a whole bunch of middle-aged 
seniors behave like a flock of Aens in a crisis, I can’t think Who’s that out 
tneie, conducting that strident conversation with a top window ^ Oh ’ 
I think it’s Baker’s young man Well, discipline must be observed, I 
suppose Give me the house-telephone, would you ^ Thanks I don’t see 
how we’re to prevent this last outbreak from getting — Oh * Martha • 
The Dean’s compliments, if you please, to Miss Baker, and will she 
kmdly bear m mind the rule about morning visitors — And the students 
are getting rather arinoyed about the destruction of their property I 
think they’re actually getting worked up to calhng a J G R meeting, 
and It’s very unfair on them, poor lambs, to let them go on suspecting 
one another, but what can we do about it ^ Thank God, it’s the last week 
of term ^ I suppose we’re not making a ghastly mistake ^ It must be one 
of us, and not a student or a scout ” 

“ We seem to have e l i m inated the students— unless it’s a conspiracy 
between two of them It might be that Hudson and Gattennole together 
But as for the scouts — I can show you this, now, I suppose Would any of 
the scouts quote Virgil ^ ” 

“ No,” said the Dean, examinmg the “ Harpy ” passage “ No , it 
doesn’t seem likely Oh, dear * ” 


The reply to Harriet’s letter arrived by return 
My dear Harriet, 

It IS exceedingly good of you to be bothered with my graceless 
nephew I am afraid the episode must have left you with an unfortu- 
nate impression of both of us 

I am very fond of the boy, and he is, as you say, attractive , but he 
IS rather easily led, and my brother is not, in my opimon, handling 
him in the wisest w^ay Considering his expectations, Gerald w kept 
152 



absurdly short of money, and naturally he feels he has a right to 
anything he can lay hands on Still, he must learn to draw the line 
between carelessness and dishonesty I have offered to augment his 
allowance myself, but the suggestion was not well received at home 
His parents, I know, feel that I am stealing bis confidence from them , 
but if I refused to help him, he would go elsewhere and get himself 
into w'orse trouble Though I do not like the position into which I am 
forced of “ Godlm is the friend, not Short,” I still think it better that 
he should turn to me than to an outsider I call this family pnde , it 
may be mere vamty , I know it is vexation of spirt 
Let me assure you that so far, when I ha\e trusted Gerald with 
anything, he has not let me down He is amenable to some of the 
shibboleths But he is not amenable to a discipline alternate indul- 
gence and severity , and indeed I do not know who is 
I must again apologise for troubling you wxth our family affairs 
What on earth are you doing in Oxford ^ Ha\ e vou retired from the 
w^’orid to pursue the contemplative life ^ I will not attempt to dissuade 
you now, but shall address you on the subject in the usual form on the 
ist Apnl next 

Yours in aU gratitude, 

P D B W 

I had forgotten to say, thank-you for telling me about the accident 
and reassuring me as to its results It was the first I had heard of it — 
as old James Forsyte says, “ Nobodv e\er tells me anything ” I will 
oblige with a few kind words 

” Poor old Peter ’ ” said Harriet 

The remark probably deserves to be mcluded in an anthology of Great 
First Occasions 


Lord Samt-George, when she went to pay him a parting visit, was 
considerably improved m appearance , but his expression was worried 
His bed strewm with untidy papers, he seemed to be trying to cope with 
his affairs and to be making but heavy w^eather of it He brightened up 
considerably at sight of Hamet 

“ Oh, look * You’re just the person I’ve been praying for I’ve no head 
for this kind of thing, and all the beastly bills keep slidmg off the bed I 
can wnte my name pretty well, but I can’t keep track of things I’m sure 
I’ve paid some of these brutes twice over ” 

“ Let me help , can I ^ ” 

“ I hoped you’d say that It’s so nice of you to spoil me, isn’t it ^ I 
can’t think how things mount up so They rook one shockingly at these 
places But one must have something to eat, mustn’t one ^ And belong to

mistake was going round with that bunch in Town last vac Mother 
imagines they’ie O K because they’re in the stud-book, but they’re

her white-headed boy with them Sad degeneracy of old landed families, 
and that kind of thing Solemn lebuLe by learned judge I somehow got 
behindhand with things about the New Year, and never caught up again 
It looks to me as though Uncle Peter was going to get a bit of a shock 
He’s wntten, hy the way Much moie like himself” 

He tossed the letter over 

Dear Jerry, 

Of all the thundenng nuisances that ever embittered the lives of 
their long-sufFenng relatives, you are the worst For God’s sake put 
down that blooUv \lfa before you kill yourself, strange as it may 
appear, I still retain some lingering remnants of affection for you I 
hope they take your licence away for life, and I hope you feel like hell 
\ou probably do Don’t worry any more about the money 
I am writing to thank Miss Vane for her kindness to you She is a 
person whose good opmion I value, so be merciful to my feelings as a 
man and an uncle 

Banter has just found three silver threads among the gold He is 
incredibly shocked He begs to tender you his respectful commisera- 
tion, and advises scalp-massage (for me, I mean) 

When you can manage it, send a Ime to report progress to your 
querulous and rapidly-decaying uncle, 

P W 

He’ll get a whole crop of silver threads when he realises that I hadn’t 
paid up the insurance,” said the viscount, callously, as he took the letter 
back 

What * ” 

Fortunately there was nobody else involved, and the police weren’t 
on the spot But I suppose I shall hear from the Post Office about their 
blasted telegraph pole If I have to go before the magistrates and the 
Governor hears of it, he’ll be annoyed It’ll cost a bit to get the car put 
nght I’d throw the damned thing away, only Dad gave it to me in one 
of his generous fits And of course, about the first thing he asked when I 
came out from i nder was whether the insurance was all nght And being 
m no state to argue, I said Yes If only it doesn’t get into the papers 
about the insurance, we’re all right — only the repairs will make a nice 
little Item in Uncle Peter’s total ” 

Is it fair to make him pay for that ^ ” 

** Damned unfau,” said Lord Samt-George, chcerfull> The Gover- 
nor ought to pay the msurance himself He’s like the Old Man of

fair to make Uncle Peter pay for all the horses that fail dov^m ^vhen one 
backs them Or for ail the rotten httle gold-diggers one carts lound, 
either I shall have to lump them together under ‘ Sundries ’ And he’ll 
say * Ah ves * Postage stamps, telephone calls and h\e wires * And then 

I shall lose my head and say, * Well, Unde ’ I hate those sentences 

that start with ‘ Well, Uncle ’ They always seem to go on and on and 
lead an>>v\^here ” 

“ 1 don’t suppose he’ll ask for details, if you don’t volunteer them 
Look ^ I’ve got all these bills soited Shall I write out the cheques for you 
to sign ^ ” 

“ I w^ish you would No, he won’t ask He’ll only sit looking harmless

** Fm not very good at arithmetic You’d better check this up It looks 
a bit unlikely, but I can’t make it come any less ” 

** Add on, say a hundred and fifty, estimated repairs to car, and then 
we’ll see Oh, hell * what have we here ^ ” 

“ The portrait of a blmkmg idiot,” said Harriet, irresistibly 

“ Amazin’ fellow, Shakespeare The apt word for all occasions Yes , 
there’s a ‘ Weil, Uncle ’ look about this, all nght Of course, I get my 
quarter’s allowance at the end of the month, but there’s the vac to get

hinted that I ought to pay my own doctor’s bill, but I wasn’t taking the

“ As a matter of fact, I do, rather ” 

“ But I can’t keep on saying * IVIiss Vane ’ to a person who knows all

“ Very well We wall continue to rob Peter to pay all It’s wonderful

“ But you don’t seem very susceptible Poor Uncle Peter * ” 

“ It will be poor Uncle Peter by the time you’ve fimshed” 

“ That’s what I mean Fifty-three, mnetfeen, four — it’s shocking the

gone before you’ve time to look at it Thirty-one, fourteen Twelve, mne, 
SIX Five, fifteen, three What’s all this tale about ghosts playing merry 
hell in Shrewsbury ^ ” 

Harriet jumped “ Damn * which of our httlc beasts told you about 
that?” 

“ None of ’em told me I don’t encourage women students Nice girls, 
no doubt, but too grubby There’s a chap on my staircase who came up 
to-day with a story . I forgot, he told me not to mention it What’s 
It all about ? and why the hush-hush ? ” 

Oh, dear * and they were implored not to talk They never think of 
the harm this kind of tlung does to the College ” 

** Well, but It’s only a rag, isn’t it ? ” 

“ I’m afraid it’s a bit more than that Look here, if I tell you why it’s 
hush-hush, will you promise not to pass it on ? ” 

Well,” said Lord Samt-George, candidly, ” you know how my 
tongue runs away with me I’m not very dependable ” 

‘‘ Your uncle says you are ” 

“ Uncle Peter ? Good lord ^ he must be potty Sad to see a fine brain 
gomg to rack and rum Of course, he’s not as young as he was 
You’re looking very sober about it ” 

It IS rather gnm, really. We’re afraid the trouble’s caused by some- 
body who’s not quite right m her head Not a student — but of course we 
can’t very well tell the students that, especially when we don’t know who 
It is ” 

The viscount stared ** Good lord » How beastly for you » I quite see 
your point Naturally you don’t want a thing like that to get about Well, 
I’ll not say a word — ^honestly, I won’t And if anybody mentions it I’ll 
register a concentrated expression of no enthusiasm, I say * Do you know, 
I wonder if I’ve met your ghost” 

15^ 



“ Met her ^ 

** Yes I certainly met somebody who didn’t seem quite all there It 
scared me a bit You’ll be the first person I’ve told about it ” 

“ Wlien was this ^ Tell me about it ” 

“ End of last term I was awfully short of cash, and I’d had a bet with 

a man that I’d get into Shrewsburv and ” He stopped and looked up 

at her with the smile that was so uncannily not h^s own “ What do you 
know about that ^ ” 

If you mean that bit of the wall by the private gate, it’s having a 
set of spikes put on it The revolving sort ” 

“ Ah • all is known Weil, it wasn’t an aw^ullv good night for it — full 
moon and ail that — but it seemed about the last chance to get that ten 
quid, so I hopped over There’s a bit of a garden there ” 

The Feiiow^s’ Garden Yes ” 

“ Yes Weil, I was just pushing along there, when somebody hopped 
out from belund a bush and grabbed me Mv heart nearly shot right out 
of my mouth on to the lawn I wanted to do a bunk ” 

“ What was the person like ^ ” 

“ It was m black and had a bit of black stuff sort of tvns^ed round its 
head I couldn’t see anything but its eyes, and they looked beastly So 1 
said, * Oh, gosh * ’ and she said, ‘ Which of ’em do you want ^ * in a 
horrid voice, like glue Well, that wasn’t mce and not what I expected 
I don’t pretend to be a good boy, but such were not my intentions at the 
time So I said, ‘ Nothing of that sort , I only made a bet I wouldn’t be 
caught, and I have been caught, so I’ll go away and I’m sorry * So she 
said, * Yes, go away We murder beautiful boys like you and eat their 
hearts out ’ So I said, ‘ Good God * how very unpleasant * ’ I didn’t like 
it a bit ” 

** Are you making all this up ^ ” 

“ Honestly, I’m not Then she said, ‘ The other one had fair hair, too ' 
And I said, ‘ No, did he really ’ And she said something, I forget what 
— ^it seemed to me she had a Lind of a hungry look about her, if you know 
what I mean — and anyhow, it was all most uncomfortable, and I said* 
* Excuse me, I think I’d better be getting along,* and I pulled free (she 
was uncommonly strong m the wrists) and legged it over the wall like 
one, John Snuth ” 

Harnet looked at him, but he appeared to be perfectly senous 

‘‘ How tall was she ^ ” 

“ About your height, I should think, or a bit less Honestly, I v/as too 
scared to notice much I couldn’t recognise her again, I don’t think She 
didn’t give me the impression of bemg a young thing and that’s about all 
I can tell you ” 

“ And you say you’ve kept this remarkable story to yourself^ ” 

Yes Doesn’t sound like me, does it ^ But there was something about 
it — I don’t know If I’d told any of the men, they’d have thought it 

157 



faowiingly funny But it wasn’t So I didn’t mention it It didn’t seem the 
nght thing, somehow ” 

“ Fm glad you didn’t want it laughed at ” 

** No The boy has quite mce instincts Well, that’s all Twenty-five, 
eleven, nine , that blasted car simply eats oil and petrol — all those big 
engines do It’s gomg to be awfully awkward about that insurance 
Please, dear Aunt Harriet, need I do any more of these ^ They depress 
me 

You can leave them till I’ve gone, and write all the cheques and 
envelopes yourself” 

“ Slave-driver I shall burst into tears ” 

“ I’ll fetch you a handkerchief” 

“ You are the most unwomanly woman I ever met Uncle Peter has 
my sincere sympathy Look at this ’ Sixty-mne, fifteen — ^account 
rendered , I wonder what it was all about ” 

Harnet said nothing, but continued to make out the cheques 

One thing, there doesn’t seem to be much at Blackwell’s A mere 
tnfle of six pounds twelve ” 

One halfpennyworth of bread to this intolerable deal of sack ” 

“ Did you catch that habit of quotation from Uncle Peter ^ ” 

“ You needn’t lay any more burdens on your Uncle’s shoulders ” 
“Must you rub it There’s practically nothing at the wine- 
merchant’s either Hard dnnkmg has quite gone out Isn’t that satis- 
factory ^ Of course, the Governor obliges wnth a bottle or two from time 
to time Did you like that Nierstemer the other day? Uncle Peter 
obliged with that How*^ many more of these things are there ? ” 

“ Quite a few ” 

“ Oh * My arm aches hombly ” 

“ If you’re really too tired ” 

“ No I can manage ” 

Half an hour later, Harnet said, “ That’s the lot ” 

“ Thank God * Now talk prettily to me ” 

“ No , I must get back now I’ll post these on my way ” 

“ You’re not really going ? Right away ? ” 

“ Yes , right away to London ” 

“ Wish I was you Shall you be up next term ? ” 

“ I don’t know ” 

“ Oh, dear, oh, dear ^ Well, kiss me good-bye mcely ” 

Since she could think of no form of refusal that might not provoke 
some ncr\e-shattermg comment, Harriet sedately complied She was 
turning to go, when the nurse amved to announce another visitor This 
was a young woman, dressed m the more foolish extreme of the current 
fasbon, with an mtoxicated-lookmg hat and bnght purple finger-nails, 
who advanced, crying sympathetically 
** Oh, darling Jerry * How too rumously shattering ^ ” 

15a 



** Good lords Gillian * ” said the viscount, without very much 

enthusiasm How did >ou ^ ” 

‘‘ My lamb ’ You don’t sound ver>' pleased to see me ” 

Harriet escaped, and found the nurse in the passage, putting an armful 
of roses in a bowl 

I hope I haven’t tired your patient too much with all that 
business ” 

** I’m glad you came to help him out with it , it was on his mind 
Aren’t these roses beautiful ^ The young ladv brought them from 
London He gets a lot of visitors But you can’t wonder, can you ^ he’s a 
dear boy, and the things he sayib to Sister * It’s as much as one can do to 
keep a straight face He’s looking a lot better now, don’t you think ^ Mr 
Whybiow’s made a beautiful job of the cut on his head He’s got hjs 
stitches out now — oh, yes * it’ll hardly shov/ at all It 2 ^ a mercy, isn’t it ^ 
Because he’s ever so handsome ” 

“ Yes , he’s a very good-looLmg young man 

“ He takes after his father Do you know the Duke of Denver ^ he’s 
ever so handsome, too I shouldn’t call the Duchess good-looking , more 
distinguished She was ternbly afraid he might be disfigured for life, and 
it would have been a pity But Mr Whybrow’s a splendid surgeon You’ll 
see he’ll be quite all right Sister’s ever so pleased — we tell her she’s quite 
lost her heart to Number Fifteen I’m sure we shall all be sorry to say 
good-bye to him , he keeps us all lively ” 

“ 1 expect he does ” 

“ And the way he pulls Matron’s leg Impudent young monkey, she 
calls him, but she can’t help laughing at his ways Oh, dear ! there’s 
Number Seventeen ringing again I expect she wants a bed-pan You 
know your way out, don’t you ^ ” 

Harnet departed , feeling that it might be rather an onerous position 
to be aunt to Lord Saint-George 


” Of course,” said the Dean, “ if anything should happen m vaca- 
tion ” 

** I rather doubt if it will,” said Harnet “ Not a big enough audience 
A public scandal is the thing aimed at, I imagine But if another episode 
should occur, it will narrow the field ” 

‘‘ Yes , most of the S G R will be away Next term, what with the 
Warden, Miss Lydgate and myself definitely clear of suspicion, we ought 
to be able to patrol the place better What are you going to do ? ” 

‘‘ I don’t know I’ve been rather thinking of coming back to Oxford 
altogether for a time, to do some work This place gets you It’s so com- 
pletely uncommercial I think I’m gettmg a httle shrill m my mind I 
need mellowing ” 

” Why not work for a B.Litt ? ” 


*59 



That would be rather fun I*m afraid they wouldn’t accept Lefanu, 
would they ^ It would have to be somebody duliei I should enjoy a 
httle dullness One would have to go on writing novels for bread and 
butter, but Td like an academic and meaty egg to my tea for a change ” 
“ Well, I hope you’ll come back for part of next term, anyway You 
can’t leave Miss Lydgate now till those proofs are in the printer’s hands ” 
“ I’m almost afraid to set her loose this vac She is dissatisfied with her 
chapter on Gerard Manley Hopkins , she feels she may have attacked him 
from the wrong angle altogether ” 

“ Oh, no » ” 

“ Fm afraid it’s Oh, yes * Well, I’ll cope with that, anyway 
And the rest — ^well, we shaU see what happens ” 

Harriet left Oxford just after lunch As she was putting her suit-case 
in the car, Padgett came up to her 

** Excuse me, miss, but the Dean thinks you would like to see this, miss 
In iVliss de Vine’s fireplace it was found this mornmg, miss ” 

Harriet looked at the half-burnt sheet of crumpled newspaper Letters 
had been cut out from the advertising columns 
** Is Miss de Vine still in College ^ ” 

She left by the lo lo, miss ” 

** I’Q keep this, Padgett, thank you Does Miss de Vine usually read 
the Datljf Trumpet ^ ” 

“ I shouldn’t think so, miss It would be more likely the Times or 
Telegraph But you could easy find out ” 

“ Of course, anybody might have dropped this in the fireplace It 
proves nothing But I’m very glad to have seen it Good mormng, 
Padgett ” 

“ Good mormng, muss ” 


CHAPTER XI 

Leave me, O Love, winch reachest but to dust 
And thou, my mind, aspire to higher things , 

Grow rich in that which never taketh rust. 

Whatever fades, but fading pleasures brings 
Draw m thy beams, and humble all they might 
To that sweet yoke where lasting freedoms be , 

Which breaks the clouds, and opens forth the light 
That doth both shine and give us sight to see 

SIR PHILIP SIDISEY 

Town seemed remarkably empty and uninteresting Yet a lot of things 
were going on Harriet saw her agent and publisher, signed a contract 
i6q 



for serial rights j heard the iimer history of the quanel between Lord 
Gobbersleigh the newspaper proprietor and Mr Adrian Gloot die 
reviewer, entered warmly into the triangular dispute raging among 
Gargantua Colour-Talkies Ltd , Mr Garrick Druiy the actor and Mrs 
Snell-Wilrmngton author of Pmstor-flower Fie^ and into the details of Miss 
Sugar TooDin^s monstrous hbel action against the Duily Headline^ and was, 
of course passionately interested to learn that Jacqueline Squills had 
made a malicious expos6 of her second divoiced husband’s habits and 
character m her new novel Gas-Fdled Bulbs 

Yet, somehow, these distractions failed to keep her amused To make 
matters worse, her new mystei*y novel had got somehow stuck She had 
five suspects, neatly confined m an old water-mill with no means erf 
entrance or egress except by a plank bridge, and all provided with 
motives and alibis for a pleasantly original kind of murder There seemed 
to be nothing fundamentally wrong with the thing But the permutations 
and combinations of the five people’s relationships were beginning to take 
on an unnatural, an incredible symmetry/ Human beings were not like 
that , human problems were not like that , what you really got was two 
himdred or so people running like rabbits in and out of a college, doing 
their work, living their lives, and actuated all the time by motives 
unfathomable even to themselves, and then, m the midst of it all — not a 
plain, undeistandable muraer, but an unmeamng and inexpLcable 
lunacy 

How could one, m any case, understand other people’s motives and 
feelings, when one’s own remained mysterious ^ Why did one look for- 
ward with irritation to the receipt of a letter on April ist, and then feel 
alarmed and affronted when it did not arrive by the first post ^ Very 
likely the letter had been sent to Oxford There was no possible urgency 
about it, since one knew what it would contain and how it had to be 
answered , but it was annoying to sit about, expecting it 

Ring Enter secretary with telegram (this was probably it) Word> and 
unnecessary cable from American magazme representative to say she 
was shortly arriving in England and very anxious to talk to Ivliss Harriet 
Vane about a story for their publication Cordially Wliat on earth did 
these people want to talk about ^ You did not write stones by talking 
about them 

Ring Second post Letter with Italian stamp (Slight delay m sorting, 
no doubt ) Oh, thank you, Miss Bracey Imbecile, writing very bad 
English, was eager to translate MiSs Vane’s works into Italian Could 
Miss Vane inform the wnter of what books she had composed ^ Trans 
iators were all like that — no English, no sense, no backing Harriet said 
brefiy what she thought of them, told Miss Bracey to refer the matter to 
the agent and returned to her dictation 

“ Whlfhd stared at the handkerchief What was it doing there m 
Winchester’s bedroom ^ With a cunoxis feeimg of ” 

G 



Telephone Hold on a moment, please (It couldn’t very well be that , 
It would be ridiculous to put through an expens* ve foreign call ) Hullo ’ 
Yes Speaking Oh^ 

She might have known it There was a Lind of mild determination 
about Reggie Poinfret Would Miss \"ane, could Miss Vane put up with 
his compan> for dinner and the new show at the Palladium ^ That night ^ 
the next night ^ Any night ^ That veiy mght ^ Mr Pomfret was inarti- 
culate with pleasure Thank you Ring off Where weie we, Miss Bracey ^ 

“ With a curious feeling of— Oh, yes, Wilfrid Very distressing for 
Wiifnd to find his young woman’s handkerchief in the murdered man’s 
bedroom Agonising A curious feeling of— What should you feel like 
under the circumstances, Miss Bracey ^ ” 

“ I should think the laundry had made a mistake, I expect ” 

“ Oh, Miss Bracey * Well — ^we’d better say it was a lace handkerchief 
Winchester couldn’t have mistaken a lace handkerchief for one of his own, 
whatever the laundry sent him ” 

“ But would Ada have used a lace handkerchief. Miss Vane ^ Because 
she’s been made rather a boyish, out-door person And it’s not as if she 
was in evemng dress, because it was so important she should turn up in 
a tweed costume ” 

“ That’s true Well — ^well, better make the handkerchief small, but not 
lace Plain but good Turn back to the description of the handkerchief 
Oh, dear » No, I’ll answer it Yes ^ Yes ? Yes ^ No, I’m afraid 
I can’t possibly No, really Oh ^ Well, you had better ask my agents 
Yes, that’s nght Good-bye • Some club wanting a debate on 
‘ Should Gemus Marry ^ ’ The question’s not likely to concern any of 
their members personally, so why do they bother? • Yes, Miss 
Bracey ^ Oh, yes, Wilfrid Bother Wilfrid * I’m takmg quite a dislike to 
the man ” 

By tea-time, Wilfnd was behaving so tiresomely that Harnet put him 
away m a rage and sallied out to attend a hterary cocktail party The 
room m which it was held was exceedingly hot and crowded, and all the 
assembled authors were discussing {a) publishers, {b) agents, {c) their 
own sales, {d) other people’s sales, and {e) the extraordmary behaviour 
of the Book of the Moment selectors in awarding their ephemeral crown 
to Tasker Hepplewater’s Mock Turtle “ I finished this book,” one dis- 
tinguished adjudicator had said, ‘‘ with the tears running down my face ” 
The author of Serpent^ s Fang confided to Harriet over a petite sauctsse and 
a glass of sherry that they must have been tears of pure boredom , but 
the author of Dusk and Shiver said. No— they were probably tears of 
merriment, called forth by the unmtentional humour of the book ; had 
she ever met Hepplewater ^ A very angry young woman, whose book had 
been passed over, declared that the whole thmg was a notorious farce. 
The Book of the Moment was sdiected from each publisher’s hst m turn, 
so that her own Anadne Adams was autonaatically excluded from benefit, 
162 



owing to the meie fact that her publisher’s impruit had been honoured 
in the previous January She had, however, received pnvate assurance 
that the cntic of the Mormng Star had sobbed like a child over the last 
hundred pages of Armdne, and vv^ould probably make it lois Book of the 
Fortnight, if only the publisher could be persuaded to take advertising 
space m the paper The author of The Squeezed Lerron agreed that adver^ 
tismg was at the bottom of it had they heard how the Daily Flashlight had 
tried to blackmail Humphrey Quint into advertising with them ^ And 
how on his refusal, the> had said darkiv, “ Well, you know what will 
happen, Mr Quint ^ ” And hoi^? no single Qumt book had received so 
much as a review from the Flashlight ever since ^ And now Quint had 
advertised that fact m the Morning Star and sent up his net sales 50 per 
cent in consequence ^ Well, by some fantastic figure, anyhow. But the 
author of Primrose Dalliance said tnat with the Book of the Moment crowd, 
what counted was Personal Puil— suielv they remembered that Hepple- 
water had married Walton Strawberry’s latest wife’s sister The author 
of Jocund Day agreed about the Pull, but thought that in this instance it 
was political, because there was some powerful anti-Fascist propaganda 
in Mock Turtle and it was well known that you could always get old Sneep 
Fortescue with a good smack at the Blacksliirts 

** But what’s Mock Turtle about ^ ” inquired Harnet 

On this point the authors were for the most part vague , but a young 
man who wrote humorous magazine stones, and could therefore afford 
to be wide-minded about novels, said he had reaa it and thought it 
rather interesting, only a bit long It was about a swimming instructor at 
a watenng-place, who had contracted such an unfortunate anti-nudity 
complex through watching so many bathing-beauties that it completely 
inhibited all his natural emotions So he got a job on a whaler and fell m 
love at first sight with an Eskimo, because she was such a beautiful 
bundle of garments So he married her and brought her back to live in a 
suburb, where she fell in love with a vegetarian nudist So then the 
hvisband went slightly mad and contracted a complex about giant 
turtles, and spent all his spare time staring into the turtle-tank at the 
Aquarium, and watchmg the strange, slow monsters swimming sigmfi- 
cantly roxmd m their encasing shells But of course a lot of things came 
into it — it was one of those books that reflect the author’s reactions to 
Things m General Altogether, significant was, he thought, the word to 
descnbe it 

Harriet began to feel that there might be somelhmg to be said even 
for the plot oi Death Hwixt Wind and Water It was, at least, significant of 
nothing in particular 

Harnet went back, irntated, to Mecklenburg Square As she entered 
the house, she could hear her telephone rmging apoplectically on the 
first fioor She ran upstairs hastily— one never knew with telephone calk 
As she thrust her key into the lock, the telephone stopped dead 



“ Damn * ” said Harriet There was an envelope lying inside the door 
It contained press cuttings One referred to her as Miss Vines and said 
she had taken her degree at Cambridge , a second compared her work 
unfavourably with that of an American thnlier-wnter , a third was a 
belated review of her last book, which gave away the plot , a fourth 
attributed somebody else’s thnller to her and stated that she “ adopted 
a sporting outlook on life ” (whatever that might mean) ** This,” said 
Harriet, much put out, “ is one of those days < Apiil the First, indeed * 
And now Pve got to dine with this dashed undergraduate, and be made 
to feel the burden of incalculable age ” 

To her surprise, however, she enjoyed both the dinner and the show 
There was a refreshing lack of complication about Reggie Pomfret He 
knew nothing about hterary jealousies , he had no views about the com- 
parative impoitance of personal and professional loyalties , he laughed 
heartily at obvious jokes , he did not expose your nerve-centres or his 
own , he did not use words with double meamngs , he did not challenge 
you to attack him and then suddenly roll himself into an armadiUo-like 
ball, presenting a smooth, defensive surface of iromcal quotations , he 
had no overtones of any kmd , he was a good-natured, not very clever, 
young man, eager to give pleasure to some one who had shown him a 
kmdncss Harriet found him quite extraordinarily restful 
“ Will you come up for a moment and have a drink or anything ^ ” 
said Harriet, on her own doorstep 

Thanks awfully,” said Mr Pomfret, “ if it isn’t too late ” 

He instructed the taxi to wait and galumphed happily up Harriet 
opened the door of the flat and switched the light on Mr Pomfret 
stooped courteously to pick up the letter lying on the mat 
** Oh, thank you,’’ said Hamet 

She preceded him mto the sitting-room and let him remove her cloak 
for her A moment or two later, she became aware that she was still 
holdmg the letter m her hand and that her guest and she were still 
standing 

I beg your pardon Do sit down ” 

“ Please— ” said Mr Pomfret, with a gesture that mdicated, Read 
It and don’t mind me.” 

“ It’s nothing,” said Hamet, tossing the envelope on the table ** I 
know what’s in it What will you have ^ Will you hdp yourself^ ” 

Mr Pomfret surveyed such refreshments as offered themselves and 
asked what he might nux for her The dnnk question being settled, there 
was a pause 

” Er— -by the way,” said Mr Pomfret, is Miss Cattermole all right ? 
I haven’t seen very much of her since— since that mght when I made 
your acquaintance, you know East time we met she said she was working 
rather l^rd ” 

** Oh, y<K I beheve she is She’s got Mods next term ” 



** Oh, poor girl * She has a great admuation for you ” 

** Has she ^ I don®t know why I seem to remember ticking her off 
rather bnitaiiy 

“ Well, you were fairly huxx with me But I agree with Jvliss Gattennole 
Absolutely, I mean, we agiee aoout having a gicat admiration for you ** 
How nice of you,” said Harriet, mattentive^y 
** Yes, really Rather I’il nevei forget the \»ay you tackled that fellow 
Jukes Did you see he got himself mto trouble only a week or so later ^ ” 
“ Yes Fm not surprised ” 

“ No A most unpleasant wart Thoroughly sca>y * 

** He always was ” 

“ Well, here’s to a long stretch for comrade JJses Not a bad show 
to-night, don’t you think ^ ” 

Hainet pullea herself together She was all at once tired of Mr 
Pomfret and wished he would go , but it was monstrous of her not to 
behave politely to him She exerted herself to talk with bright interest of 
die entertainment to which he had kindly taken her and succeeded so 
well that it was nearly fifteen minutes before !Mr Pomfiet remembered 
his waiting taxi, and took himself off m high spirits 
Harriet took up the letter Now that she was free to epen it, she did not 
want to It had spoilt the evening for her 

Dear Harriet, 

I send in my demand notes with the brutal regularity of the income- 
tax commissioners , and probably you say when you see the envelopes 
* Oh, God ' I know what this is ’ The only difference is that, some time 
or other, one has to take notice of the mcome-tax 

Willyou memy me ^ — It’s begmmng to look like one of those lines in a 
farce — ^merely boring till it’s said often enough , and after that, you get 
a bigger laugh every time it comes 
I should like to write you the kmd of words that burn ^he paper they 
are written on — but words hke that have a wav of being not only 
unforgettable but unforgivable You will burn the paper in any case , 
and I would rather there should be nothing m it that you cannot forget 
if you want to 

Well, that’s over Don’t worry about it 

My nephew (whom you seem, by the w^ay, to have stimulated to the 
most extraordinary diligence) is cheering my exile by dark hints that 
you arc involved in some disagreeable and dangerous job of work 
at Oxford about which be is in honour bound to say notliing I hope 
he IS mistaken But I know that, if you have put anything in hand, 
disagrecabieness and danger will not turn you back, and God forbid 
they should Whatever it is, you have my best washes for it, 

I am not my own master at the moment, and do not know where I 

165 



be sent next or when I shall be back-soon, I trust In the 
meantime may I hope to hear from time to time that all is well vnih 
you^ 

Yours, more than my own, 
Peter Wimsey, 

After reading that letter, Harriet knew that she could not rest till it was 
answered The bitter unhappiness of its opening paragraphs was readily 
explained by the last two He probably thought— he could not possibly 
help thinking — that she had known him all these years, only to confide 
in the end, not m him, but in a boy less than half his age and his own 
nephew, whom she had known only a couple of weeks and had little 
reason to trust He had made no comment and asked no questions — that 
made it v/orse More generously still, he had not only refrained from 
offera of help and advice which she might have resented , he had 
dehberatei> acknowledged that she had the right to run her own risks 
Do be careful of yourself” , ** I hate to think of your being exposed to 
unpleasantness ’ , “ If only I could be there to protect you ” , any such 
plirase would express the normal male reaction Not one man m ten 
thousand would say to the woman he loved, or to any woman “ Dis« 
agreeableness and danger will not turn you back, and God forbid they 
should ” That w^as an admission of equality, and she had not expected it 
of him If he conceived of marriage along those lines, then the whole 
problem would have to be reviewed in that new hght , but that seemed 
scarcely possible To take such a line and stick to it, he would have to be, 
not a man but a miracle But the busmess about Saint-George must be 
cleared up immediately She wrote quickly, without stopping to think 
too much 

Dear Peter, 

No I can’t see my way to it But thank you all the same About the 
Oxford busmess — I would have told you sill about it long ago, only that 
It is not my secret I wouldn’t have told your nephew, only that he had 
stumbled on part of it and I had to trust him with the rest to keep him 
from making unmtentional mischief I wish I could tell you , I should 
be very glad of your help , if ever I get leave to, I will It is rather 
disagreeable but not dangerous, I hope. Thank you for not telling me 
to run away and play — that’s the best compliment you ever paid me 
I hope your case, or whatever it is, is getting on all nght It must be 
a tough one to take so long 

Harriet 

Lord Peter Wunsey read this letter while seated upon the terrace of an 
hotel overlooking the Pmcian Gardens, which were bathed m brilliant 
sunshine. It astonished him so much that he was reading it for the fourth

set his elbows on the table and leaned forward, thumb-tip to Ihumb-tip 
and little-finger-tip to little-finger- tip, smumg, iireSiStible Forty minutes 
later, he took his leave, still smiling, having ceded, without noticmg it, 
rather more than he had gained, and told in ten words more than he had 
learned in a thousand 

But of this interlude Harriet naturally knew nothing On the evening 
of the same day, she w^as dimng alone, a little depressed, at Romano’s 
She had nearly finished, when she saw a man, just leaving the restaurant, 
who was sketching a vague gesture of recognition He was in tlie forties, 
going a little bald, wnth a smooth, vacant face and a dark moustache For 
a moment she could not place him , then something about his languid 
walk and impeccable tailonng brought back an afternoon at Lord’s 
She smiled at him, and he came up to her table 

“ Hullo — ullo ^ Hope I’m not bargin’ m How’s all the doings and all 
that ? ” 

“ Very well, thanks ” 

“ That’s grand Thought I must just ooze over and pass the time of 
day Or mght Only I was afraid you wouldn’t remember me, and might 
think I was bein’ a nuisance ” 

Of course I remember you You’re Mr Arbuthnot — ^the Honour- 
able Frederick Arbuthnot — and you’re a fnend of Peter Wimsey’s, and 
I met you at the Eton and Harrow match two years ago, and you’re 
married and have two children How are they ” 

“ Fair to middlin’, thanks What a bram you’ve got ^ Yes, ghastly hot 
afternoon that w^as, too Can’t think why harmless women should be 
dragged along to be bored while a lot of httle boys play off their Old 
School Ties (That’s meant for a joke ) You were frightfully weli- 
behaved, I remember ” 

Harriet said sedately that she alwa> s enjoyed a good cncket match 

167 



Do you ^ I thought it was politeness It’s pretty slow work, if you ask 
me But I was never any good at it myself It’s all right for old Peter He 
can always work himself into a stew thinking how much better he’d have 
done It himself ” 

Harriet offered him coffee 

‘‘ I didn’t know anybody ever got into a stew at Lord’s I thought it 
wasn’t done ” 

“ Well, the atmosphere doesn’t exactly remind one of the Gup Final , 
but mild old gentlemen do sometimes break out into a spot of tut-tuttery 
How about a brandy ^ Waiter, two liqueur brandies Are you writing 
any more books ^ ” 

Suppressing the rage that this question always rouses in a professional 
writer, Harriet admitted that she was 

“ It must be splendid to be able to write,” said Mr Arbuthnot “ I 
often think I could spin a good yarn myself if I had the brains About the 
odd things that happen, you know Queer deals, and that kind of 
thing ” 

A dim recollection of something Wimsey had once said lit up the 
labyrinth of Harriet’s imnd Money That was the connection between 
the two men Mr Arbuthnot, moron as he might be in other respects, 
had a flair for money He knew what that mysterious commodity was 
going to do , It was the one thing he did know, and he onlv knew that by 
instinct When things were preparing to go up or down, they rang a 
little warmng bell in what Freddy Arbuthnot called his mind, and he 
acted on the warmng without being able to explain why Peter had 
money, and Freddy understood money , that must be the common 
interest and bond of mutual confidence that explained an otherwise 
inexplicable friendship She admired the strange nexus of interests that 
umtes the male half of mankind mto a close honeycomb of cells, each 
touching the other on one side only, and yet constituting a tough and 
closely adhering fabnc 

“ Funny kind of story popped up the other day,” went on Mr Arbuth- 
not “ Mysterious business Couldn’t make head or tail of it It would 
have amused old Peter How is old Peter, by the way ^ ” 

“ I haven’t seen him for some time He’s in Rome I don’t know what 
he’s doing there, but I suppose he’s on a case of some kind ” 

** No I expect he’s left his country for his country’s good It’s usually 
that I hope they manage to keep tlungs quiet The exchanges are a bit 
nervy ” 

Mr \rbuthnot looked almost mteliigeat 
What’s Peter got to do with the exchange ^ ” 

” Nothing But if anything blows up, it’s bound to affect the 
exchange ” 

** This IS Greek to me WTiat is Peter’s job out there ^ ” 

“ Foreign Office Didn’t you know ^ ” 
i68 



hadn’t the slightest idea He’s not permanently attached there. 


“ In Rome, do you mean ’ ” 

“ To the Foreign Office ” 

“ No , but they sometimes push him out when they think he’s wanted 
He gets on with people ” 

** I see I wonder why he never mentioned it ” 

“ Oh, everybody knows , it’s not a secret He probably thought it 
wouldn’t interest you ” Mr Arbuthnot balanced ms spoon across his 
coffee-cup m an abstracted way “ I’m damned fond of ola Peter,” was 
his next, rather irrelevant, contribution “ He’s a dashed good sort Last 
time I saw him, I thought he seemed a bit under the weatiier Weil, 
I’d better be toddling ” 

Ke got up, a little abruptly, and said good night 
Harriet thought how humiliatirg it was to have one’s ignorance 
exposed 

Ten days before the beginning of term, Harriet could bear London no 
longer The final touch was put to her disgi*st by the sight of an advance 
notice of Death ^twixt Wind and Water, embodying an exceptionally ful- 
some blurb She developed an acute homesickness for Oxford and for the 
Siuefy of Lefanu — a book which would never have any advertising value, 
but of which some scholar might some day moderately observe, ** Miss 
Vane has handled her subject with insight and accuracy ” She lang up 
the Bursar, discovered that she could be accommodated at Shrewsbury, 
and fled back to Academe 

College was empty, but for herself, the Bursar and Treasurer, and Miss 
Barton, who vanished daily into the Radcliffe Camera and was only seen 
at meals The Warden was up, but remained m her own house 
April was runmng out, chilly and fickle, but with the promise of good 
things to come , and the city wore the withdrawn and secretive beauty^ 
that wraps her about in vacation No clamour of young voices echoed 
along her ancient stones , tlie tumult of flying bicycles was stilled m the 
narrow strait of the Turl , in Radcliffe Square the Camera slept like a 
cal m the sunshine, disturbed only by the occasional visit of a slow-footed 
don , even in the High, the roar of car and charabanc seemed minished 
and brought low, for the holiday season was not yet , punts and canoes, 
new-fettled for the summer term, began to put forth upon the Cherwell 
like the varnished buds upon the horse-chestnut tree, but as yet there was 
no press of traffic upon the shimng reaches , the mellow bells, soaring 
and singing m tower and steeple, told of time’s flight through an eternity 
of peace , and Great Tom, tolling his mghtly hundred-and-one, called 
home only the rooks from off Christ Church Meadow 
Mormngs in Bodley, drowsing among the worn browns and tarmshed 
gildmg of Duke Humphrey, snufiing the famt, musty odour of slowly 
penshmg leather, hearing only the discreet tippety-tap of Agag-feet along 
6^ 169 



the padded floor , long afternoons, taking an outngger up the Cher, 
feeling the rough kiss of the sculls on unaccustomed palms, listemng to 
the rhythmical and satisfying ker-kiunk of the rowlocks, watching the 
play of muscle on the Bursar’s sturdy shoulders at stroke, as the sharp 
spring wind flattened the thin silk shirt against them , or, if the day were 
warmer, flickmg swiftly in a canoe under Magdalen walls and so by the 
twisting race at King’s iVIill by Mesopotamia to Faison’s Pleasure , then 
back, with mind relaxed and body stretched and vigorous, to make toast 
by the Are , and then, at mght, the lit lamp and the drawn curtain, with 
the flutter of the turned page and soft scrape of pen on paper the only 
sounds to break the utter silence between quarter and quarter chime 
Now and again, Harriet took out the dossier of the poison-pen and looked 
it over , yet, viewed by that sohtary lamp, even the ugly, printed sciawls 
looked harmless and impersonal, and the whole dismal problem less 
important than the determimng of a first edition date or the settlement 
of a disputed reading 

In that melodious silence, something came back to her that had lam 
dumb and dead ever since the old, innocent undergraduate days The 
singing voice, stifled long ago by the pressure of the struggle for exist- 
ence, and throttled into dumbness by that queer, unhappy contact with 
physical passion, began to stammer a few uncertam notes Great golden 
phrases, nsmg from nothmg and leading to nothing, swam up out of her 
dreaming nund hke the huge, sluggish carp in the cool waters of Mercury 
One day she dimbed up Shotover and sat looking over the spires of the 
city, deep-down, fathom-drowned, stnkmg from the roimd bowl of the 
nver-basm, improbably remote and lovely as the towers of Tir-nan-Og 
beneath the green sea-rollers She held on her knee the loose-leaf note- 
book that contamed her notes upon the Shrewsbury scandal , but her 
heart was not m that sordid inquiry A detached pentameter, echoing 
out of nowhere, was beatmg m her ears— seven marching feet — o. 
pentameter and a half — 

To that still centre where the spuming world 

Sleeps on its axis — 

Had she made it or remembered it ^ It sounded familiar, but m her 
heart she knew certainly that it was her own, and seemed fkmiliar only 
because it was mevitable and right 

She opened the note-book at another page and wrote the words down 
She felt like the man m the Punch story Nice little barf-room, Liza — 
what shall we do with it ^ Blank verse ^ • No . it was part of 

the octave of a sonnet . it had the feel of a sonnet But what a 
rhyme-sound * Curled ^ furled ^ , she fumbled over rhyme and 
metre, like an unpractised musician fingenng the keys of a disused 
instrument 

Then, with many false starts and blank feet, returrung and fiilmg and 
170 



erasing painfully as she went^ she began to again, knomng with a 
deep inner certainty that somenovv, after long and bitter wandering, she 
was once more in her ow^n place 

Here, then, at home 

the centre, the middle sea, the heart of the lab/nnth 

Here, then, at home, bv no more storms d strest, 

Stay we our steps — course — flight — ^hands folded and wings furled 

Here, then, at home, bv no more storms distrest. 

Folding laborious hands we s^t, wings furled , 

Here in close perfume lies the rose-leaf curled, 

Here the sun stands and knows not eaat nor west, 

Here no tide runs , we have come, last and best, 

From the wide zone through dizzying circles hurled, 

To that still centre where the spinning wodd 
Sleeps on its axis, to the heart of rest 

Yes , there was something there, though the metre halted monoto- 
nously, lacking a free stress-shift, and the chime “ duzying-spinmng ** 
was unsatisiactory The lines swayed and lurched m hei clumsy hands, 
uncontrollable Still, such as it was, she had an octave 
And there it seemed to end She had reached the full close, and had 
nothing more to say She could find no turn for the sestet to take, no 
epigram, no change of mood She put down a tentative line or two and 
crossed them out If the right twist would not come of itself, it was useless 
to manufacture it She had her image — ^the world sleeping Idee a great 
top on its everlasting spmdle — and anything added to that w^ould be mere 
verse-making Somethmg might come of it some day In the meanwhile 
she had got her mood on to paper — and this is the release that all writers, 
even the feeblest, seek for as men seek for love , and, havmg found it, 
they doze off happily into dreams and trouble their heads no further 
She shut up the note-book, scandal and sonnet together, and began to 
make her way slowly down the steep path Half-wa> down, she met a 
small party coming up two small, flaxen-haired girls in charge of a 
woman whose face seemexi at first only vaguely famihar Then, as they 
came close, she realised that it was Annie, looking strange without her 
cap and apron, taking the children for a walk 
As in duty bound, Harriet greeted them and asked where they were 
living now 

“ WeVe found a very mce place in Headington, madam, thank you* 
Fm stopping there myself for my holiday These are my littie girls 
one’s Beatrice and this is Carola Say how-do-you-do to Miss Vane 
Harriet shook hands gravely with the children and asked then ages and 
how they were getting on 


171 



“ It’s mce for you having them so close ” 

“ Yes, madam I don’t know what I should do without them ” The 
look of quick pnde and joy was almost fiercely possessive Harriet got a 
ghmpse of a fundamental passion that she had, as it were, forgotten when 
she made her reckoning , it blazed across the serenity of her sonnet-mood 
like an ominous meteor 

“ They’re all I ha\e— now that I’ve lost their father ” 

“ Oh, dear, yes,” said Harriet, a little uncomfortably “ Has he — how 
long ago was that, Anme ^ ” 

“ Three years, madam He was driven to it They said he did what he 
ought not, and it preyed on his mind But I didn’t care He never did any 
harm to anybody, and a man’s first duty is to his wife and family, isn’t 
it ^ I’d have starved with him gladly, and worked my fingers to the bone 
to keep the children But he couldn’t get over it It’s a cruel world for 
anyone with his way to make and so much competition ” 

“ Yes, mdeed,” said Harriet The elder child, Beatrice, was looking up 
at her mother with eyes that were too intelligent for her eight years It 
would be better to get off the subject of the husband’s wrongs and iniqui- 
ties, whatever they nught be She murmured that the children must be a 
great comfort 

“ Yes, madam There’s nothing like having children of your own. They 
make hfe worth living Beatrice here is her father’s living image, aren’t 
you, darlmg ^ I was sorry not to have a boy , but now I’m glad It’s 
difficult to bring up boys without a father ” 

** And what are Beatrice and Garola going to be when they grow 

“ I hope they’ll be good girls, madam, and good wives and mothers — 
that’s what I’ll brmg them up to be ” 

“ I want to nde a motor-cycle when I’m bigger,” said Beatrice^ 
shakmg her curls assertively 

** Oh, no, darling What things they say, don’t they, madam ^ ” 

“ Yes, I do,” said Beatrice “ I’m going to have a motor-cycle and keep 
a garage ” 

“ Nonsense,” said her mother, a little sharply “ You mustn’t talk so 
That’s a boy’s job ” 

** But lots of girls do boys’ jobs nowadays,” said Harnet 
“ But they ought not, madam It isn’t fair The boys have hard enough 
work to get jobs of their own Please don’t put such things mto her head, 
madam. You’ll never get a husband, Beatrice, if you mess about m a 
garage, getting all ugly and dirty ” 

" I don’t want one,” said Beatrice, firmly “ I’d rather have a motor- 
cycle ” 

Anme looked annoyed , but laughed when Harnet laughed 
“ She’ll find out some day, won’t she, ^ ” 

« Very likely she will,” said Harriet If the woman took the view that 

m

any husband was better than none at all, it was useless to argue And she 
had rather got into the habit of shy mg at all discussion that turned upon 
men and marriage She said good-afternoon pleasantly and strode on, a 
httle shaken in her mood, but not unduly so Either one liked discussing 
these matters or one did not And when tnere were ugly phantoms lurk- 
ing in the corners of one’s mind, skele*-ons that one dared not show to 
anybody, even to Peter — 

'Well, of course not to Peter , he was the last person And he, at any 
rate, had no mche in the grey stones of Oxford He stood for London, for 
the swift, rattling, chattenng, excitable and devilishly upsetting world of 
strain and uproar Here, at the still centre (yes, that line was definitely 
good), he had no place For a whole week, she had scarcely given him a 
thought 

And then the dons began to arrive, full of their vacation activities and 
ready to take up the burden of the most exacting, yet most lovable term 
of the academic year Harriet watched them come, wondering which of 
those cheerful and determined faces concealed a secret Miss de Vine 
had been consulting a library m some ancient Flemish tOv\m, where was 
preserved a remarkable family correspondence dealing with trade condi- 
tions between England and Flanders under Elizabeth Her mird was full 
of statistics about wool and pepper, and it was difficult to get her to think 
back to what she had done on the last day of the Hilary Term She had 
undoubtedly burnt some old papers — there might have been newspapers 
among them — certainly she never read the Daily Trumpet — ^she could 
throw no light on the mutilated newspaper found in the fireplace 

Miss Lydgate — as Harriet had expected — ^had contnved in a few short 
weeks to make havoc of her proofs She was apologetic She had spent a 
most interesting long week-end with Professor Somebody, "who was a 
great authonty upon Greek quantitative measures , and he had dis- 
covered several passages that contained inaccuracies and thrown an 
entirely fresh light upon the argument of Chapter Seven Hamet 
groaned dismally 

Miss Shaw had taken five of her students for a reading-party, had seen 
four new plays and bought a rather exating summer outfit Miss Pykc 
had spent an enthralling time assisting the curator of a local museum to 
put together the fragments of three figured pots and a quantity of bunal- 
urns that had been dug up in a field in Essex Miss Effilyard was really 
glad to be back m Oxford , she bad had to spend a month at her sister’s 
house while the sister was havmg a baby , looking after her brother-in- 
law seemed to have soured her temper The Dean, on the other hand, 
had been helping to get a mece married and had found the whole busi- 
ness full of humour, “ One of the bridesmaids went to the wrong church 
and only turned up when it was all over, and tnere were at least two 
hundred of us squeezed into a room that would only hold fifty, and I 
only got half a glass of champagne and no wedding-cake, my tummy was 



Sapping against my spine , and the bndegroom lost his hat at Ihe last 
moment, and my dear > would you believe ii ^ people still give plated 
biscuit-barrels » Miss Ghilpenc had gone with her fianc(^ and his sister 
to a number of interestmg places to study mediaeval domestic sculpture 
Miss Burrows had spent most of her time playing golf There arrived also 
a reinforcement m the person of Miss Edwards, the Science tutor, just 
returned from taking a term’s leave She was a young and active woman, 
square m face and shoulder, with bobbed hair and a stand-no-nonsense 
manner The only member missmg from the Senior Common Room was 
Mrs Goodwin, whose small son (a most unfortunate child) had come out 
with measles immediately upon his return to school and again required 
bis mother’s nursing 

Of course she can’t help it,” said the Dean, “ but it’s a very great 
nuisance, just at the beginmng of the Summer Term If Fd only known, 
I could have come back earlier ” 

“ I don’t see,” observed Miss Hillyard, grimly, ** what else you can 
expect, if you give jobs to widows with children You have to be prepared 
for these perpetual interruptions And for some reason, tliese domestic 
pre-occupations always have to be put before the work ” 

** Well,” said the Dean, ‘‘ one must put work aside in a case of serious 
illness ” 

“ But all children get measles ” 

** Yes , but he’s not a very strong child, you know His father was 
tubercular, poor man — m fact, that’s what he died of— and if measles 
should turn to pneumoma, as it so often does, the consequences might be 
senous ” 

“ But has it turned to pneumonia ^ ” 

** They’re afraid it may He’s got it very badly And, as he’s a nervous 
hide creature, he naturally likes to have his mother with him And in 
any case, she’d be m quarantine.” 

The longer she stays with him, the longer she’ll be in quarantme ” 

It’s very tiresome, of course,” put in Miss Lydgate, mildly “ But if 
Mrs Goodwm had isolated herself and come back at the earliest possible 
moment — as she very bravely offered to do— she would have been 
suffermg a great deal of anxiety ” 

great manv of us have to suffer from anxiety in one way or 
another,” saj.d Miss Hillyard, sharply ” I have been very anxious about 
my sister It is always an anxious business to have a first baby at thirty- 
five But if the ev ent had happened to occur in term-time, it would have 
had to take place without my assistance ” 

” It is always difficult to say which duty one should put first,” said 
Miss Pyke “ Each case must be decided individually I presume that, in 
bringing children into the world one accepts a certain responsibility 
towards them.” 

** Pm not denying it,^’ said Miss Hillyard “ But if the domestic respon- 

174 



sibility IS to take precedence of the public responsibility, then the work 
should he handed over to some one else to do ” 

“ But the children must be fed and clothed,” said !Miss Edwards 
“ Quite so But the mother should not take a resident post ** 

“ Mis Goodivin is an excellent secretary,” said the Dear “ I should 
be ver> sorry to lose ner And it*s nice to th^nk that we are able to help 
her m her very difBcult position ” 

Miss Hillyard lost patience 

“ The fact is, though you will never admit it, that everybody m this 
place has an infenonty complex about married women and children 
For all your talk about careers and independence, vou all behevt in your 
hearts that we ought to abase ourselves before an> woman who has 
fulfilled her animal functions ” 

** That IS absolute nonsense,” said the Bursar 

“ It IS natural, I suppose, to feel that married women lead a fuller 
life,” began Miss Lydgate 

“ And a more useful one,” retorted Miss Hillyard Look at the fuss 
that’s made over * Shrewsbury grandchildren ’ • Look how delighted vou 
all are when old students get married ’ As if you were saying ‘ Aha ’ 
education doesn’t unfit us for real life after all ^ ’ And when a really 
brilliant scholar throws away all her prospects to marry a curate, you say 
perfunctorily, * What a pity * But of course her o^vn life must come 
arst ’ ” 

“ I’ve never said such a thing,” cned the Dean indignantly ” I always 
say they’re perfect fools to maiTy ” 

“ I shouldn’t mind,” said Miss Hillyard, unheeding, “ if you said 
openly that intellectual interests were only a second-best , but you 
pretend to put them hrst in theory and are ashamed of them in practice.” 

“ There’s no need to get so heated about it,” said Miss Barton, 
breaking m upon the angry protest of ^fiss Pyke “ After all, so?ne of us 
may have deliberately chosen not to marry And, if you will forgive my 
saying so ” 

At this ominous phrase, always the prelude to something quite 
unforgivable, Harriet and the Dean broke hastily into the discussion 

“ Considering that we are devotmg our whole lives ” 

“ Even for a man, it is not always easy to sa> ” 

Their common readiness confounded their good intention Each broke 
off and begged the other’s pardon, and Miss Barton went on unchecked 
“ It IS not altogether wise — or commemg — to show so much animus 
against marned women It was the same unreasonable prejudice th«#t 

made you get that scout removed from your staircase ” 

“ I object,” said Miss Hillyard, with a heightened colour, ** to this 
preferential treatment I do not see why we should put up with slackness 
on duty because a servant or a secretary happens to be a widow with 
children I do not see why Annie should be given a room to herself in 

175 



the Scouts’ Wing, and charge over a corridor, when servants who have 
been here for longer than she has have to be content to share a room I 
do not ” 

“ Well,” said Miss Stevens, “ I think she is entitled to a little con* 
sideration A woman who has been accustomed to a nice home of her 
own ” 

“ Very likely,” said Miss Hillyard “ At any rate, it was not my lack 
of consideration that led to her precious children being placed m the 
charge of a common thief ” 

“ I was always against that,” said the Dean 

** And why did you give m ^ Because poor Mrs Jukes was such a 
nice woman and had a family to keep She must be considered and re- 
warded for bemg fool enough to marry a scoundrel What’s the good of 
pretending that you put the interests of the College first, when you 
hesitate for two whole terms about getting nd of a dishonest porter, 
because you’re so sorry for his family ^ ” 

There,” said Miss Allison, “ I entirely agree with you The College 
ought to come first in a case like that ” 

“ It ought always to come first Mrs Goodwin ought to see it, and 
resign her post if she can’t carry out her duties properly ” She stood up 
** Perhaps, however, it is as well that she should be away and stay away 
You may remember that last time she was away, we had no trouble from 
anonymous letters or monkey-tncks ” 

^Iiss Hillyard put down her coffee-cup and stalked out of the room 
Everybody looked uncomfortable 
Bless my heart * ” said the Dean 

Something very wrong there,” said Miss Edwards, bluntly 
She’s so prejudiced,” said Miss Lydgate “ I always think it’s a very 
great pity she never married ” 

Miss Lydgate had a way of putting into language that a child could 
understand things which other people did not say, or said otherwise 
I should be sorry for the man, I must say,” observed Miss Shaw , 

but perhaps I am showing an undue consideration for the male sex 
One IS almost afraid to open one’s mouth ” 

“ Poor ^Irs Goodwin * ” exclaimed the Bursar ” The very last 
person ^ ” 

She got up angrily and went out Miss Lydgate followed her Miss 
Ghilpenc, who had said nothing, but looked quite alarmed, murmured 
that she must get along to work The Common Room slowly cleared, and 
Harriet was left with the Dean 

“ Miss Lydgate has the most ternfying way of hitting the nail on the 
head,” said Miss Martin , “ because it is obviously much more likely 
that 

** A great deal more likely,” said Harnet 



Mr Jenkyn was a youngish and agreeable don whom Harnet had met 
the pievious term at a party in North Oxford — the same party, in fact, 
which had led to her acquaintance with Mr Reginald Pomfret He 
resided at Magdalen, and was incidentally one of the pro-Proctors 
Harnet had happened to say something to him about tne Magdalen 
May-day ceremony, and he had promised to send her a ticket for the 
Tower Being a scientist and a man of scrupulously exact mind, he 
remembered his promise , and the ticket duly arrived 
None of the Shrewsbury SCR was gomg Most of them had been up 
on May mormngs before Miss de Vine haa not , but tiiough she had 
been offered tickets, her heart would not stand the stairs There were 
students who had received invitations , but they were not students whom 
Harnet knew She therefore set off alone, well before sunnse, having 
made an appointment to meet ]Miss Edwards when she came down and 
take an outrigger down to the Isis for a pipe-openei before having 
breakfast on the river 


The choristers had sung their hymn The sun had risen, rather red and 
angry, casting a faint flush over the roofs and spires of the waking city 
Harriet leaned over the parapet, looking down upon the heart-breaking 
beauty of the curved High Street, scarcely disturbed as yet by the roar of 
petrol-driven traffic Under her feet, the tower began to swing to the 
swinging of the bells The little group of bicyclists and pedestrians far 
below began to break up and move away Mr Jenkyn came up, said a 
few pleasant words, remarked that he had to hurry off to go bathmg with 
a friend at Parson’s Pleasure , there was no need for her to hurry — could 
she get down the stairs all right alone ^ 

Harnet laughed and thanked him, and he took leave of her at the 
stair-head She moved to the East side of the tower There lay the nver 
and Magdalen Bridge, with its pack of pimts and canoes Among them, 
she distinguished the sturdy figure of Miss Edwards, m a bright orange 
jumper It was wonderful to stand so above the world, with a sea of 
sound below and an ocean of air above, all mankind shrunk to the pro- 
portions of an ant-heap True, a cluster of people still lingered upon the 
tower itself— her compamons in this airy hermitage They too, spell- 
bound with beauty — 

Great Scott * What was that girl trying to do ^ 

Harnet made a dive at the young woman who was just placing one 
knee on the stonework and drawing herself up between two crenellations 
of the parapet 

“ Here * ” she said, “ you mustn’t do that It’s dangerous ” 

The girl, a thin, fair, frightened-looking child, desisted at once 
“ I only wanted to look over ” 

Well, that’s very silly of you You might get giddy You’d better 

177 



come along down It woiild be very unpleasant for the Magdalen 
authorities if anyone fell over They might have to stop letting people 
come up ** 

Fm so sorry I didn’t think ” 

** Well, you should think Is anybody mth you ^ ” 

“ No ” 

^ Fm going down now , you’d better come too ” 

<* Very well ” 

Harriet shepherded the girl down the dark spiral She had no proof 
of anything but rash curiosity, but she wondered The girl spoke with a 
slightly common accent, and Harriet would have put her down for a 
shop-assistant, but for the fact that tickets for the Tower were more 
hkely to be restricted to Umversity people and tiieir friends She might 
bean undergraduate, come up with a County Scholarship In any case, 
one was perhaps attaching too much importance to the incident 
They were passing the bell-chamber now, and the brazen clamour 
was loud and insistent It reminded her of a story that Peter Wimsey had 
told her, years ago now, one day when only a resolute determination to 
talk on and on had enabled him to prevent a most unfortunate outing 
from ending m a quarrel Something about a body m a belfry, and a 
flood, and the great bells bawling the alarm across three counties 
The noise of the bells died down behind her as she passed, and the 
recollection with it , but she had paused for a moment in the awkward 
descent, and the girl, whoever she was, had got ahead of her When she 
reached the foot of the stair and came out into clear daylight, she saw 
the slight figure scurrving off through the passage into the quad She was 
doubtful whether to pursue it or not She followed at a distance, watched 
it turn townwards up the High, and suddenly found herself almost in the 
arms of Mr Pomfret, coming down from Qiieen’s m a very untidy grey 
flannel suit, with a towel over his arm 
“ Hullo * ” said Mr Pomfret “ You been saluting the sunrise ^ ” 

“ Yes Not a very good sunrise, but quite a good salute ” 

“ / thmk It’s going to ram,” said Mr Pomfret “ But I said I would 
bathe and I am bathing ” 

“ Much the same here,” said Harnet “ I said I’d scull, and I’m 
sculling ” 

“ Aren’t we a pair of heroes ? ” said Mr Pomfret He accompanied 
her to Magdalen Bridge, was hailed by an imtable friend in a canoe, who 
said he had been waiting for half an hour, and went off up-river, 
grumbling that nobody loved him and that he knew it was going to ram 
Hamct joined Miss Edwards, who said, on hearing about the girl 
** Well, you might have got her name, I suppose But I don’t see what 
one could do about it It wasn’t one of our people, I suppose ^ ” 

** I didn’t recognise her And she didn’t seem to recognise me ” 

Then it probably wasn’t Pity you didn’t get the name, all the same

People oughtn^t to do that kind of thing Inconsiderate. Will you take 
bow or stroke ^ ”

The arrival of Miss Edwards, together with the rearrangements of 
residences due to the completion of the Library Building, greatly 
strengthened the hands of authority at the opening of the Trinity Term. 
jMiss Barton, Miss Burrows and Miss de Vme moved into the three new 
sets on the ground-floor of the Library , Miss Chilpenc was transferred 
to the New Quad, and a general redistribution took place , so that 
Tudor and Burleigh Buildings were left entirely denuded of dons Miss 
Martm, Harriet, Miss Edwards and Miss Lydgate estabhshed a system of 
patrols, by which the New Quad, Queen Elizabeth and the Library 
Building could be visited mghtly at irregular intervals and an e>e kept 
on all suspicious movements 

Thanks to this arrangement, tlie more \ lolent demonstrations of the 
Poison-Pen received a check It is true that a few anonymous letters 
continued to arrive by post, containing scurrilous insinuations and 
threats of revenge against various persons Harriet w^as carefully docket- 
ing as many of these as she could hear of or lay hands on — she noticed 
that by this time every member of the S G R had been persecuted, with 
the exception of Mrs Goodwin and Miss Chilpenc in addition, the 
Third Year taking Schools began to receive sinister prognostications 
about their prospects, while Miss Flaxman was presented with an ill- 
executed picture of a harpy tearing the flesh of a gentleman in a mortar- 
board Harriet had tned to elinunate Miss Pyke and Miss Burrows from 
suspiaon, on the ground that they were both fairly skilful with a pencil, 



and would therefore be incapable of producing such bad drawings, even 
by taking thought , she discovered, however, that, though both were 
dexterous, neither of them was ambidexterous, and that their left-handed 
efforts were quite as bad as anything produced by the Poison-Pen, if not 
worse JMiss Pyke, indeed, on being shown the Harpy picture, pointed 
out that It was, in several respects, inconsistent with the classical con- 
ception of this monster , but there again it was clearly easy enough for 
the expert to assume ignorance , and perhaps the eagerness with which 
she drew attention to the madental errors told as much against her as in 
her favour 

Another tnfimg but cunous episode, occurring on the third Monday 
m term, was the complamt of an agitated and conscientious First-Year 
that she had left a harmless modern novel open upon the table m the 
Fiction Library, and that on her return to fetch it ^ter an afternoon on 
the river, she had found several pages from the middle of the book— just 
where she was reading — ^npped out and strewn about the room The 
First- Year, who was a County Council Scholar, and as poor as a church 
mouse, was almost in tears , it really wasn’t her fault , should she have 
to replace the book ^ The Dean, to whom the question was addressed, 
said, No , It certainly didn’t seem to be the First-Year’s fault. She made 
a note of the outrage “ The Search by C P Snow, pp 327 to 340 removed 
and mutilated. May 13th,” and passed the information on to Harriet, 
who incorporated it in her diary of the case, together with such items as 
“ March 7— abusive letter by post to Miss de Vine,” " March 1 1, do to 
Miss Hiliyard and Miss Layton,” “ April 29— Harpy drawing to Miss 
Flaxman,” of which she had now quite a formidable list 

So the Su mm er Term set m, sun-flecked and lovely, a departing April 
whirled on wmd-spurred feet towards a splendour of May Tuhps danced 
in the Fellows’ Garden , a fringe of golden green shimmered and 
deepened upon the sascular beeches , the boats put out upon the Cher 
between the budding banks, and the wide reaches of the Isis were 
strenuous with practising eights Black gowns and summer frocks 
Buttered up and down the streets of the city and through the College 
gates, making a careless heraldry with the green of smooth turf and the 
siiver-sable of ancient stone , motor-car and bicycle raced perilously 
side by side through narrow turnings and the wail of gramophones made 
hideous the water-ways from Magdalen Bridge to far above the new^ 
By-pass Sun-bathers and untidy tea-parties desecrated Shrewsbury Old 
Qpad, newly-whitened tennis-shoes broke out hke strange, imwholesome 
flowers along plinth and wmdow-ledge, and the Dean was forced to issue 
a ukase in the matter of the bathing-dresses which flapped and fluttered, 
flag-fashion, from every coign of vantage Solicitous tutors began to 
cluck and brood tenderly over such ripening eggs of scholarship as were 
destined to hatch out comply in the Examination Schools after their 
three-years* mcubation , candidates, realising with a pang that they had 



now fewer than eight weeks in which to make up for cut lectures and 
misspent working hours, went flashing from Bodiey to lecture-room and 
from Camera to coaching , and the thin trickle of abuse from the Poison- 
Pen was swamped and well-nigh forgotten in that stream of genial 
commination always poured out from the hps of examinees elect upon 
examining bodies Nor, in the onset of Schools Fever, was a lighter note 
lacking to the general delirium The draw for the Schools Sweep was 
made in the Semor Common Room, and Harriet found herself furnished 
with the names of two “ horses,’* one of whom, a Miss Newland, was said 
to be well fancied Harriet asked who she was, having nevei to her 
knowledge seen or heard of her 

“ I don’t suppose you have,” said the Dean “ She’s a shy child But 
Miss Shaw thinks she’s pretty safe for a First ” 

“ She isn’t looking well tins term, though,” said the Bursar “ I hope 
she isn’t going to have a break-down or anything I told her the other day 
she ought not to cut Hall so often ” 

“ They will do it,” said the Dean “ It’s all very well to say they can’t 
be bothered to change when they come off the river and prefer pyjamas 
and an egg m their rooms , but I’m sure a boiled egg and a sardine aren’t 
sustaimng enough to do Schools on ” 

And the mess it all makes for the scouts to clear up,” grumbled the 
Bursar ” It’s almost impossible to get the rooms done by eleven when 
they’re crammed with filthy crockery ” 

” It isn’t being out on the rivei that’s the matter with Newland,” said 
the Dean ‘‘ That child works ” 

” All the worse,” said the Bursar ” I distrust the candidate who swots 
in her last term I shouldn’t be a bit surprised if your horse scratched, 
Miss Vane She looks nervy to me ” 

” That’s very depressing,” said Harriet “ Perhaps I’d better sell half 
my ticket while the price is good I agree with Edgar Wallace, ‘ Give me 
a good stupid horse who will eat his oats * Any offers for Newland ^ ” 

“ What’s that about Newland ^ ” demanded Miss Shaw, coimng up to 
them They were having coffee in the Fellows’ Garden at the time ” By 
the way, Dean, couldn’t you put up a notice about sitting on the grass m 
the New Quad ^ I ha\e had to chase two parties off We cannot have the 
place looking like Margate Beach ” 

“ Certainly not They know quite well it isn’t allowed Why are women 
undergraduates so sloppy ^ ” 

“ They’re always exceedingly anxious to be like the men,” said Miss 
Hillyard, sarcastically, ‘‘ but I notice the likeness doesn’t extend to 
showing respect for the College grounds ” 

” Even you must admit that men have some virtues,” said Miss Shaw 
” More tradition and disciplme, that’s all,” said Miss Hillyard 
” I don’t know,” said Miss Edwards ” I think women are messier by 
nature They are naturally picmc-mmded ” 

i8x 



It’s nice to sit out in the open air m this lovely weather,” suggested 
Miss Chilpenc, almost apologetically (for her student days were not far 
behind her) and they don’t think how awful it looks ” 

“ In hot weather,” said Harriet, moving her chair back into the 
shade, men have the common sense to stay indoors, where it’s cooler ” 

Men,” said Miss Hillyard, have a passion for frowst ” 

** Yes,” said Miss Shaw, “ but what were you saying about Miss New- 
land ^ You weren’t offenng to sell your chance, Miss Vane, were you ^ 
Because, take it from me, she’s a hot favourite She’s the Latymer 
Scholar, and her work’s bnlhant ” 

“ Somebody suggested she was off her feed and hkely to be a non- 
starter ” 

“ That’s very unkind,” said Miss Shaw, with mdignation Nobody’s 
any right to say such things ” 

“ I think she looks harassed and on edge,” said the Bursar ” She’s too 
hard-working and conscientious She hasn’t got the wind-up about 
Schools, has she ^ ” 

** There’s nothing wrong with her work,” said Miss Shaw “ She does 
look a little pale, but I expect it’s the sudden heat ” 

“ Possibly she’s worried about things at home,” suggested Mrs, Good- 
win. She had returned to College on the 9th May, her boy having taken 
a fortunate turn for the better, though he was still not out of the wood 
She looked anxious and sympathetic. 

She’d have told me if she had been,” said Miss Shaw “ I encourage 
my students to confide m me Of course she’s a very reserved girl, but I 
have done my best to draw her out, and I feel sure I should have heard 
if there was anything on her mind ” 

“ Well,” said Harnet, ‘‘ I must see this horse of mine before I decide 
what to do about my sweep-stake ticket Somebody must pomt her 
out” 

“ She’s up m the Library at this moment, I fancy,” said the Dean , “ I 
saw her stewmg away there just before dinner — cutting Hall as usual I 
nearly spoke to her Come and stroll through, Miss Vane, If she’s there, 
we’ll chase her out for the good of her soul I want to look up a reference, 
anyhow ” 

Hamet got up, laughing, and accompanied the Dean 
I sometimes thmk,” said Miss Martin, “ that Moss Shaw would get 
more real confidence from her pupils if she wasn’t always probing into 
their little insides She likes people to be fond of her, which I thmk is 
rather a mistake Be bnd, but leave ’em alone, is my motto The shy 
ones shrink into their shells when they’re poked, and the egotistical ones 
talk a lot of rubbish to attract attention. However, we all have our 
methods,” 

She pushed open the Library door, halted m the end bay to consult a 
febok and verify a quotation, and then led the way through the long room 
i8ss 



At a table near the centre, a thm, fair girl was working amid a pile of 
reference books The Dean stopped 
“ You still here. Miss Newland ^ Haven’t you had anv dinner ? ” 

“ 111 have some later, Miss Klaitm It was so hot, and I want to get 
this language paper done ” 

The girl looked startled and uneasy She pushed the damp hair back 
from her forehead The whites of her eyes showed like those of a fidgety 
horse 

“ Don’t you be a little juggins,” said the Dean “ Ail work and no 
play IS simply silly m yoar Schools term If you go on like this, well have 
to send you away for a rest-cuie and forbid work altogether for a week or 
so Have you got a headache^ You look as if you had ” 

“ Not very much, Miss Martm ” 

“ For goodness’ sake,” said the Dean, “ chuck that perishing old 
Ducange and Meyer-Lubke or whoever it is and go away and play I’m 
always having to chase the Schools people off to the river and into the 
country,” she added, turning to Harriet, I 'wish they’d all be like Miss 
Camperdown — ^she was after your time She frightened Miss Pyke by 
dividmg the whole of her Schools term between the river and the tenms- 
courts, and she ended up with a First in Greats ” 

Miss Newland looked more alarmed than ever 
“ I don’t seem able to think,” she confessed “ I forget things and go 
blank ” 

“ Of course you do,” said the Dean, briskly “ Sure sign you’re doing 
too much Stop It at once Get up now and get yourself some food and 
then take a nice novel or somethmg, or find somebody to have a knock-up 
with you ” 

“ Please don’t bother, Miss Martm I’d rather go on with this. I don’t 
feel like eating and I don’t care about tennis — I wisk you wouldn’t 
bother she finished, rather hysterically 

“ All right,” said the Dean , “ bless you, I don’t want to fuss. But do 
be sensible ” 

“ I will, really, Miss Martm I’ll just finish this paper I couldn’t feel 
comfortable if I hadn’t I’ll have somethmg to eat then and go to bed I 
promise I will ” 

“ That’s a good girl ” The Dean passed on, out of the Library, and 
said to Harriet 

“ I don’t like to see them gettmg mto that state What do you think of 
your horse’s chance^” 

Not much,” said Harriet ** I do know her That is, I’ve seen her 
before I saw her last on Madgalen Tower ” 

“ What^ ” said the Dean Oh, lord * ” 

Of Lord Samt-George, Harriet had not seen very much durmg that 
first fortnight of term His arm was out of a sling, but a remainmg wcak- 

183 



ness m it had curbed his sporting activities, and when she did see him, he 
informed her that he was woiking The matter of the telegraph pole and 
the insurance had been safely adjusted, and the parental wrath avoided 

Uncle Peter,’* to be sure, had had something to say about it, but Uncle 
Peter, though scathing, was as safe as houses Harnet encouraged the 
young gentleman to persevere with his work and refused an invitation to 
dine and meet “ his people ” She had no particular wish to meet the 
Denvers, and had hitherto successfully avoided doing so 

Mr Pomfret had been assiduously polite He and Mr Rogers had 
taken her on the river, and had included Miss Gattermole in the party 
They had all been on their best behaviour, and a pleasant time had been 
enjoyed by all, the mention of previous encounters having, by common 
consent, been avoided Harriet was pleased with Miss Gattermole , she 
seemed to have made an effort to throw off the blight that had settled 
upon her, and Miss Hiliyard’s report had been encouraging Mr Pom- 
fret had also asked Harriet to lunch and to play tennis , on the former 
occasion she had truthfully pleaded a previous engagement and, on the 
second, had said, with rather less truth, that she had not played for years, 
was out of form and was not really keen After all, one had one’s work to 
do {Lefanuy ^Twixt Wind and Water, and the History of Prosody among them 
made up a fairly full programme), and one could not spend all one’s time 
idhng with undergraduates 

On the evening after her formal introduction to Miss Newland, 
however, Harnet encountered Mr Pomfret accidentally She had been 
to see an old Shrewsbunan who was attached to the Somerville Senior 
Common Room, and was crossing St. Giles on her way back, shortly 
before midnight, when she was aware of a group of young men in evei^- 
ing dress, standmg about one of the trees which adorn that famous 
thoroughfare Being naturally mquisitive, Harriet went to see what was 
up The street was practically deserted, except for through traffic of the 
ordinary kmd The upper branches of the tree were violently agitated, 
and Harnet, standmg on the outskirts of the little group beneath, learned 
from their remarks that Mr Somebody-or-the-other had undertaken, in 
consequence of an after-dinner bet, to climb every tree in St Giles with- 
out mterference from the Proctor As the number of trees was large and 
the place public, Harriet felt the wager to be rather optimistic She was 
just turning away to cross tlie street m the direction of the Lamb and 
Flag, when another youth, who had evidently been occupying an 
observation-post, arrived, breathless, to announce that the Proggins was 
just coming into view round the comer of Broad Street The climber 
came down lather hastily, and the group promptly scattered m all 
directionS“~some running past her, some making their way down side- 
streets, and a few bold spirits fleeing towards the small enclosure known 
as the Fender, within which (smce it belongs not to the Town but to St 
John’s) they could play at Ug with the Proctor to their hearts’ content 
184 



One of the young gentlemen darting in this general direction pa'?sed 
Harriet close, stopped with an exclamation, and brought up beside her 
Why, It’s vou * ” cried Mr Pomfret, in an excited tone 
“ Me again,” said Harriet Are you always out without your gown 
at this time of nignt ^ ” 

“ Practically always,” said Mr Pomhet, failing into step beside her 
Funny you should always catch me at it Amazing luck, isn’t it ^ 

I say, you’ve been avoiding me this term Wnv ^ ” 

‘‘ Oh, no,” said Harriet , only I’ve been rather busy ” 

“ But you have been avoiding me,” said Mr Pomfret I know you 
have I suppose it’s ridiculous to expect you to take any particular 
interest in me I don’t suppose you ever tinnk about me You probably 
despise me ” 

‘‘ Don’t be so absurd, Mr Pomfiet Of course I don’t do any’‘thing of 

the sort I like you very much, but ” 

Do vou ^ Then why won’t you let me sec you ’ Look here, I 
must see you There’s something I’ve got to tell you When can I come 
and talk to you ^ ” 

“ What about ^ ” said Harriet, seized with a sudden and awful qualm 

What about ^ Hang it, don’t be so unkmd Look here, Harriet 

No, stop, you’ve got to listen Darling, wonderful Harriet ” 

Mr Pomfret, please * 

But Mr Pomfret was not to be checked His admiration had run away 
with him, and Harriet, cornered m the shadow of the big horse-chestnut 
by the Lamb and Flag, found herself hstemng to as eager an avowal of 
devotion as any young gentleman in his twenties ever lavished upon a 
lady considerably his semor in age and expenence 

” I’m fnghtfully sorry, Mr Pomfret I never thought No, really, 

It’s quite impossible I’m at least ten years older than you are And 
besides ” 

“ What does that matter ^ ” With a large and clumsy gesture Mr 
Pomfret swept away the difference of age and plugged on in a flood of 
eloquence, which Harriet, exasperated with herseh and him, could not 
stop He loved her, he adored her, he was intensely miserable, he could 
neither work nor play games for thinking of her, if she refused him he 
didn’t know what* he should do with himself, she must have seen, she 
must have realised—he wanted to stand between hei and all the world — 
Mr* Pomfret was six feet three and broad and strong m proportion 
“ Please don’t do that,” said Harriet, feeling as though she were feebly 
saying “ Drop it, C^sar,” to somebody else's large and disobedient 

Alsauan “ No, I mean it I can’t let you ” And then m a different 

tone 

** Look out, juggins * Here’s the Proctor ” 

Mr Pomfret, in some consternation, gathered himself together and 
turned as to flee But the Proctor’s bulldogs, who had been having a 

185 



lively time with the tree-climbers in St Giles, and were now out for 
blood, had come through the archway at a smart trot, and, seeing a 
young gentleman not only engaged in nocturnal vagation w^ithout his 
gown but actually embraang a female {muher vel meretnx^ cujus consortw 
Chmtiams pmsus znterdtctum est) leapt gleefully upon him, as upon a 
lawful prey 

“ Oh, blast * ’’ said Mr Pomfret “ Here, you ” 

** The Proctor would like to speak to you, sir,” said the Bulldog, 
gnmly 

Harriet debated with herself whether it might not be more tactful to 
depart, leaving Mr Pomfret to his fate But the Proctor was close on the 
heels of his men , he was standing within a few yards of her and alread> 
demanding to know^ the offender’s name and college There seemed to be 
nothing for it but to face the matter out ' 

“Just a moment, Mr Proctor,” began Harriet, struggling, for Mr 
Porofret’s sake, to control a rebellious uprush of laughter “ This gentle- 
man IS with me, and you can’t Oh ’ good evemng, Mr Jenkyn ” 

It was, indeed, that amiable pro-Proctor He gazed at Harriet, and was 
struck dumb with embarrassment 

“ I say,” broke in Mr Pomfret, awkwardly, but with a gentlemanly 
feehng that some explanation was due from him , “ it was entirely my 
fault I mean, I’m afraid I was annoying Miss Vane She — I ” 

“ You can’t very well prog him, you know,” said Harriet, persuasively, 
“ can vou now ^ ” 

“ Come to think of it,” replied Mr Jenkyn, “ I suppose I can’t You’re 
a Semor Member, aren’t you ^ ” He waved his bulldogs to a distance 
“ I beg your pardon,” he added, a little stiffly 

“ Not at all,” said Harriet “ It’s a mce night Did you have good 
hunting m St. Giles ^ ” 

“ Two culpnts will appear before their dean to-morrow,” said the pro- 
Proctor, rather more cieerfully “ I suppose nobody came through 
here ? ” 

Nobody but ourselves,” said Hamet , “ and I can assure you that 
we haven’t been climbing trees ” 

A wicked facility m quotation tempted her to add “ except in the 
Hespendes ” , but she respected IMr Pomfret’s feelings and restrained 
herself 

“ No, no,” said Mr Jenkyn He fingered his bands nervously and 
hitched his gown with its velvet facings protectively about his shoulders 
“ I had better be away in pursuit of those that have.” 

“ Good night,” said Harriet 

“ Good mght,” said Mr Jenkyn, courteously raismg his square cap 
He turned sharply upon Mr Pomfret “ Good mght, sir ” 

He stalked aw ay with bnsk steps between the posts into Museum Road, 
his long Impipe sleeves agitated and Buttermg Between Harnet and Mr 
186 



Pomfret there occurred one of those silences mto which the first word 
spoken falls like the stroke of a gong It seemed equally impossible to 
comment on the interruption or to lesume the interrupted com ersation 
By common consent, however, they turned tbeii backs upon the pro- 
Proctor and moved out once more mto St Giles They had turned left 
and were passing through the now-deserted Fender before ^Ir Pomfret 
found his tongue 

“ A nice fool I look,” said Mr Pomfret bitterly 
“ It was very unfortunate,” said Harriet, “ but I must nave looked 
much the more foolish I very nearly ran away altogether However, all’s 
well that ends well He’s a very decent sort and I don’t suppose he’ll 
think tvN'ice about it ” 

She remembered, with another disconcerting interior gurgle of muth, 
in expression in use among the irreverent “ to catch a Semor girhng ” 
To boy” was presumably tne feminine equ valent of the verb “ to 
gill ” , she wondered w^bethcj. Mr Jenk>n would employ it in Common 
Room next day She did not grudge h^m his entertainment , being old 
enough to know tliat even the most crashing social bricks make but a 
small ripple m the ocean of time, which quickly d^es away To Mr 
Pomfret, however, the npple must inevitably appear of the dimensions of 
a maelstrom Pie was muttering suikdy something about a laughing- 
stock 

“ Please,” said Harriet, “ don’t worry about it It’s of no importance 
I don’t mmd one bit ” 

“ Of course not,” said Mr Pomfret “ Naturally, ) ou can’t take me 
senously You’re treating me like a child ” 

“ Indeed I’m not I’m very grateful — ^I’m very much honoured by 
e^rervth^ng you said to me But really and truly, it’s quite impossible ” 

“ Oh, well, never mind,” said Mr Pomfret, angrily 
It was too bad, thought Harriet To have one’s young affections 
trampled upon was galling enough , to have been naade an object of 
official ridicule as well was almost unbearable She must do something to 
restore the young gentleman’s self-respect 

“ Listen, Mr Pomfiet I don’t think I shall ever marry anybody 
Please believe that my objection isn’t personal at ail We have been very 
goodfnends Can’t we 

Mr Pomfret greeted this fine old bromide with a dreary snort 
“ I suppose,” he said, in a savage tone, ‘‘ there’s somebody else ” 

“ I don’t know that you’ve any right to ask that ” 

“ Of course not,” said Mr Pomfret, affronted “ I’ve no right to ask 
you anything I ought to apologise for asking you to marry me And for 
making a scene in front of the Proggins— in fact, for existing I’m 
exceedingly sorry ” 

Very clearly, die only balm that could in the least soothe the wounded 
vanity of Mr Pomfret would be the assurance that there was somebody 

187 



eise But Harriet was not prepared to make any such admission , and 
besides, whether there was anybody else or not, nothing could make the 
notion of marrying Mr Pomfret anything but preposterous She begged 
him to take a reasonable view of the matter , but he continued to sulk , 
and indeed, nothing that could possibly be said could mitigate the essen- 
tial absurdity of the situation To offer a lady one’s chivalrous piotection 
against the world in general, and to be compelled instead to accept her 
senior standing as a protection for one’s seif against the just indignation 
of the Proctor is, and remains, farcical 

Their ways lay together In resentful silence they paced the stones, 
past the ugly front of Balliol and the high iron gates of Trinity, past the 
fourteen-fold sneer of the Gaasars and the top-heavy arch of the Clarendon 
Building, till they stood at the junction of Cat Street and Holywell 

Well,” said Mr Pomfret, if you don’t imnd, I’d better cut along 
here It’s just going twelve ” 

** Yes Don’t bother about me Good night And thank you 
again very much ” 

Good night ” 

Mr Pomfret ran hurnedly m the direction of Queen’s College, 
pursued by a yelping chorus of chimes 

Harriet went on down Holywell She could laugh now if she wanted 
to , and she did laugh She had no fear of any permanent damage to Mr 
Pomfrel’s heart , he was far too cross to be suffering in anything but his 
vanity The mcident had that nch savour of the ludicrous which neither 
pity nor charity can destroy Unfortunately, she could not in decency 
share it with anybody , she could only enjoy it in lonely ecstasies of 
mirth What Mr Jenkyn must be thinking of her she could scarcely 
imagine Did he suppose her to be an unprincipled cradle-snatcher ^ or 
a promiscuous sexual maniac ^ or a disappointed woman eagerly grasp- 
mg at the rapidly disappearing skirts of opportunity ^ or what ^ The 
more she thought about her own pait in the episode, the funnier it 
appeared to her She wondered what she should say to Mr Jenkyn if she 
ever met him agam 

She was surprised to find how much Mr Pomfret’s simple-minded 
proposal had elated her She ought to have been thoroughly ashamed of 
herself She ought to be blanung herself for not having seen what was 
happemng to Mr Pomfret and taken steps to stop it Why hadn’t she ^ 
Simply, she supposed, because the possibility of such a thing had never 
occurred to her She had taken it for granted that she could never again 
attract any man’s fancy, except the eccentric fancy of Peter Wimsey And 
to him she was, of course, only the creature of his making and the mirror 
of his own magnanimity Reggie Pom ret’s devotion, though ridiculous, 
was at least single-nunded , he was no King Cophetua , she had not to be 
humbly obhged to him for kindly taking notice of her And that reflection, 
after all, was pleasurable However loudly we may assert our own 
z88 



unworthiness, few of us are really offended by hearing the asseition 
contradicted by a dismteiested party 
In this unregenerate mood she reached the College, and let herself in 
by the postern There were lights m the Warden’s Lodgings, and some- 
body was standing at the gate, looking out At the sound of Hamet’s 
footsteps, this person called out, in the Dean’s voice 

“ Is that you. Miss Vane The Warden wants to see you ” 

** What’s the matter, Dean ^ ” 

The Dean took Harriet by the arm 

“ Newland hasn’t come in You haven’t seen her anvwhere ^ ” 

« No — I’ve been round at Somerville It’s only just after t^velve She’ll 

probably turn up You don’t thmk ^ ” 

“ We don’t know v^hat to think It’s not like Newland to be out without 
leave And we’ve found things ” 

She led Hamet into the Warden’s sitting-room Dr Banng was 
seated at her desk, her handsome face stern and judicial In front of her 
stood Miss Haydock, with her hands thrust into her dressing-gowm 
pockets , she looked excited and angr)^ Miss Shaw, curled dismally m a 
corner of the big couch, was crying , while Miss Millbanla the Senior 
Student, half-frightened and half-defiant, hovered imeasily in the back- 
ground As Harnet came in with the Dean, everybody looked hopefully 
towards the door and then away again 
“ Miss Vane,” said the Warden, “ the Dean tells me that you saw Miss 
Newland behaving m a peculiar manner on Magdalen Tower last May- 
Day Gan you give me any more exact details about that ” 

Harnet told her story again 

I am sorry,” she added in conclusion, “ that I didn’t get her name 
at the time , but I didn’t recognise her as one of our students As a matter 
of fact, I don’t remember ever noticing her at all, until she was pomted 
out to me yesterday by Miss Martin ” 

That’s quite nght,” said the Dean ** I’m not at all surpnsed you 
shouldn’t have known her She’s very quiet and shy and seldom comes m 
to Hall or shows herself anywhere I think she wor^ nearly all day at the 
Radchffe Of course, when you told me about the May-Day business, I 
decided that somebody ought to keep an eye on her I infonmed Dr 
Banng and Miss Shaw, and I asked Miss Millbanks whether any of the 
Third Year had noticed that she seemed to be in any trouble ” 

“ I can’t understand it,” cned Miss Shaw ** Why couldn’t she have 
come to me about it ^ I always encourage my pupils to give me their full 
confidence I asked her again and again I really thought she had a real 
affection for me ” 

She smffed hopelessly into a damp handkerchief 
“ I knew something was up,” said Miss Haydock, bluntly “ But I 
didn’t know what it was The more questions you asked, the less she’d 
tell you — so I didn’t ask many 


189 



Has the girl no friends ^ ’ asked Harriet 
“ I thought she looked on me as a fnend,” complained Miss Shaw 
She didn’t make friends,” said Miss Haydock 
** She’s a very reserved child,” saia the Dean “ I don’t think anybod/ 
could make much out of her I know I couldn’t ” 

“ But uhat has happened, exactly ^ ” asked Harriet 
“ When Miss Martin spoke to Miss MiilbanLs about hei,” said Miss 
Haydock, cutting m tvithout respect of persons upon the Warden’s reply, 
” Miss Milibanks mentioned the matter to me, saying she couldn’t see 
that we could be expected to do anything ” 

“ But I scarcely knew her ” began Miss Milibanks 
** Nor did J,” said Miss Haydock “ But I thought something had 
bet+er be done about it I took her out on the river this afternoon She 
said she ought to work, but I told her not to be an idiot, or she’d crack 
up We took a punt up over the Rollers and had tea along by the Parks 
She seemed all nght then I brought her back and persuaded her to come 
and dine properly in Hall After that, she said she wanted to go and work 
at the Radder I had an engagement, so I couldn’t go with her — besides, 
I thought she’d think it funny if I trailed after her all day So I told Miss 
Milibanks that somebody else had better carry on ” 

“ Well, I earned on myself,” said Miss Milibanks, rather defiantly 
“ I took my own work across there I sat m a desk where I could see her 
She was there till half-past mne I came away at ten and found she’d 
gone ” 

“ Didn’t you see her go ^ ” 

“ No I was reading and I suppose she shpped out. I’m sorry , but how 
was I to know ^ I’ve got Schoob this term It’s all very well to say I 
oughtn’t to have taken my eyes off her, but I’m not a nurse or any- 
thing ” 

Hamet noticed how Miss Millbank’s self-assurance had broken down 
She was defending herself angrily and clumsily like a schoolgirl 

** On returmng,” pursued the Warden, “ Miss Milibanks ” 

** But has anything been done about it ^ ” interrupted Harriet, 
impatient with this orderly academic exposition ** I suppose you asked 
whether she’d been up to the gallery of the Raddiffe ” 

** I thought of that later on,” rephed the Warden, “ and suggested that 
a search should be made there I understand that it has been made, 

without result However, a subsequent ” 

** How about the nver ? ” 

I am coming to that Perhaps I had better continue in chronological 
order I can assure vou that no time has been wasted ” 

** Very well, Warden ” 

** On returning,” said the Warden, taking up her tale exactly where 
she had left it, ” Miss Milibanks told Miss Haydock about it, and they 
ascotamed that Miss Newland was not in College They then, very 
190 



propel ly, informed the Dean, who instructed Padgett to telephone through 
as soon as she came in At ii 15 sne iiad not returned, and Padgett 
reported that fact He mentioned at the same time that ne had himself 
been feeling uneasy about New land He had noticed that she had 
taken to going about alone, and that she looked strained and ner /ous.” 

“ Padgett IS pretty shrewd/’ said the Dean “ I often think be knows 
more about the stuaents than any of us ” 

Up till to-mght,” wailea Miss Snaw, “ I should have said I knew ail 
my pupils intimately ’* 

** Padgett also said he had seen several of tlie anonvmous tetters arrive 
at the Lodge for iVIiss Newland 
“ He ought to have reported that/’ said Harnet 
No/’ said the Dean “ It was after you came last term that we 
instructed him to repoit The ones he saw came before that ” 

“ I see ” 

By that time/’ said the Warden, we were beginning to feel alarmed, 
and Miss Martin rang up the police In the meantime, Ivhss Haydock 
made a searcn m hliss Newland’s room for anything that might throw 
light on her state of mind , and found— these ” 

She took a little sheaf of papers from her desk and handed them to 
Harnet, who said Good God ^ ” 

The Poison-Pen, this time, had found a victim ready made to her 
hand There were the letters, thirty or more of them (“ and I don*t 
suppose that’s the lot, cither/* was the Dean’s comment) — ^menacing, 
abusive, insinuating — all hammenng remorselessly upon the same theme 
You needn’t think you will get away with it ” — “ What will you do 
when you fail m Schools ^ “ You deserve to fail and I shall see that 

you do ” — then more hornble suggestions “ Don’t you feel your bram 
going ^ “ If they see you are going mad they wall send you down ” — 

and finally, m a sinister senes “ You’d better end it now ” — ** Better 
dead than in the loony-bm ” — In your place I should throw mvseif 
out of the window ” — Try the nver ” — and so on , the continuous, 
deadly beatmg on weak nerves that of atU things is hardest to resist, 

“ If only she had shown them to me ^ ” Miss Shaw was crying 
** She wouldn’t, of course,” said Harnet “ You ha\e to be very well 
balanced to adnut that people think you’re going mad That’s what’s 
done the mischief ” 

Of all the wicked thmgs ” said the Dean “ Think of that unfor- 

timate child collecting all these horrors and broodmg over them I Pd 
hke to kill whoever it is * ” 

** It’s a defimte effort at murdei,” said Harnet But the pomt is, has 
It come off ^ ” 

There was a pause Then the Warden said in an expressionless voice . 
“ One of the boat-house keys is missing ” 

Miss Stevens and Miss Edwards have gone up-stream m the Waters 

m 



fly/* said the Dean, “ and Miss Burrows and Miss Barton have taken the 
other sculler down to die Isis The police are searching too They’ve been 
gone about three-quaiters of an hour We didn’t discover till then that 
the key was gone.” 

“ Then there’s not much we can do/’ said Harriet, suppressing the 
angry comment that the boat-house keys should have been checked the 
moment Miss Newlaiid’s absence had been remarked Miss Haydock— 
did Miss Newland say anything to you — anything at all — ^while you 
were out, that might suggest where she was likely to go in case she wanted 
to drown herself? ” 

The blunt phrase, spoken openly for the first tune, shook everybody 
Miss Haydock put her head in her hands 

“ Wait a minute,” she said “ I do remember something We were well 
up through the Parks — ^Yes — It was after tea, and we went a bit farther 
before turmng I struck a bad bit of water and nearly lost the pole I 
remember saying it would be a nasty place to go in, because of the weeds 
It’s a bad bottom — all mud with deep holes m it Miss Newland asked if 
that wasn’t ^he place where a man had been drowned last year I said 
I didn’t know, but I thought it was near there She didn’t say anything 
more, and I’d forgotten it till this moment ” 

Harnet looked at her watch 

** Half-past nine, she was last seen She’d have to get to the boat- 
house Had she a bicycle ^ No ^ Then it would take her nearly half an 
hour Ten Say another forty minutes to the Rollers, unless she was very 
quick ” 

** She’s not a quick punter She’d take a canoe ” 

“ She’d have the wind and stream against her Say lo 45 And she’d 
have to get the canoe over the Rollers by herself That takes time But 
she would still have over an hour We may be too late, but it’s jost worth 
trying ” 

“ But she might have gone m anywhere ” 

** Of course she might But there’s just the chance People get an idea 
and stick to it And they don’t always make their minds up instantly ” 

” If I know anythmg of the girl’s psychology,” began Miss Shaw 

“ What’s the good of argmng ^ ” said Harnet “ She’s either dead or 
ahve and we’ve got to nsk a guess Who’ll come with me ^ I’ll get the car 
—we shall go quicker by road than by nver We can commandeer a boat 
somewhere above the Parks — ^if we have to break open a boat-house 
Dean ” 

** I’m with you,” said Miss Martin 

** We want torches and blankets Hot coffee Brandy Better get the 
police to send up a constable to meet us at Timms’s Miss Haydock, 
you’re a better oar than I am ” 

** I’ll come,” said Miss Haydock ” Thank God for someihmg to do ”

Lights on the river The plash of sculls The steady chock of the 
rowlocks 

The boat crept slowly down-stream The constable, crouched in the 
bows, swept the beam of a powerful torch from bank to bank Harriet 
bolding the rudder-hnes, divided her attention between the dark cur- 
rent and the moving light ahead The Dean, setting a slow and steady 
stroke, kept her eyes before her and her wits on the job 

At a word from the policeman, Harriet checked the boat and let her 
drift down towards a dismal shape* black and slimy on the black water 
The boat lurched as the man leaned out In the silence came the answer- 
ing groan, plash chuck of oars on the far side of the next bend 
“ Ail right, ’ said the policeman Oniy a bit o* sacking 
“ Ready ? Paddle » ” 

The sculls struck the water again 
“ Is that the Bursar’s boat coming up ^ ” said the Dean. 

“ Very likely,” said Harnet 

Just as she spoke, someone m tiie other boat gave a shout There was a 
heavy splash and a erv ahead, and an answenng shout from the con- 
stable 

“ There she goes * ” 

“ Pull like blazes,” said Harnet As she drew on the rudder-hnes to 
bnng their nose round the bend, she saw, across stroke’s shoulder in the 
beam of the torch, the thing they had come to find — the shimng keel of 
a canoe adrift in mid-stream, with the paddles floating beside it , and all 
around it the water ran, nnged and npphng with the shock of the plunge 
“ Look out, ladies Don’t run her down She can’t be far off” 

“ Easy » ” said Harnet And then, ‘‘ Back her » Hold her » ” 

The stream chuckled and eddied over the reversed oar-blades The 
constable shouted to the up-coming sculler, and then pointed away 
towards the left bank 
** Over by the willow there ” 

The light caught the silver leaves, dripping like ram towards the river 
Something swirled below them, pale and ommous 
“ Easy Paddle One on bow Another on bow Another Easy Paddle 
One Two Three Easy Paddle on stroke, backwater on bow One Two 
Easy Look out for your bow oars ” 

The boat svymng across the stream and turned, followmg the police- 
man’s signal He was kneehng and peenng mto the water on the bow 
side A white patch glimmered up to the surface and sank again 
“ Fetch her roimd a bit more, miss ” 

“ Ready ^ One on stroke, paddle Another Easy Hold her ” He was 
leamng out, gropmg with both hands among the nbbon-weed Back a 
little Easy Keep those bow oars out of the water Tnm the boat. Sit 
over to stroke Have you got her ^ ” 

“ I’ve got her — ^but the weeds arc oruel strong.” 

— 7 


m 



Mind you don’t go over or there’ll be two of you Miss Haydock-— 
ready, ship ^ See if you can help the constable Dean — paddle one very 
gentle stioLe and sit well over ” 

The boat rocked penlously as they heaved and tore at the clinging 
weeds, razor-sharp and strong as grave-bands The Water-fly had come 
up now and was pulling across the stream Harriet yelled to Miss Stevens 
to keep her sculls out of mischief The boats edged together The girl’s 
head was out of the water, dead-white and lifeless, disfigured with black 
slime and dark stripes of weed The constable was supporting the body 
Miss Haydock had both hands m the stream, slashing with a knife at the 
nbbon-weed that was wrapped viciously about the legs The other boat, 
hampered by its own lightness, was heeling over to stroke with gunwales 
awash, as her passengers reached and grappled 
“ Tnm your boat, damn you ’ ” said Hariiet, not pleased at the idea 
of having two fresh corpses to see to, and foi getting in her wrath to whom 
she was speaking Miss Stevens paid no attention , but Miss Edwards 
threw her weight over , and as the boat lifted tiie body lifted too Harriet, 
keeping her torch steady so that the rescueis could see what they were 
doing, watched the reluctant weeds loose their last coils and slip back 
“ Better get her in here,” said the constable Their boat had the less 
room in it, but the stronger arms and the better balance There was a 
strong heave and a violent lurch as the dead weight was hauled over the 
side and rolled m a dnppmg heap at Miss Haydock’s feet 


The constable was a capable and energetic young man He took the 
first-aid measures m hand with adnairable promptness The women, 
gathered on the bank, watched with anxious fkces Other help had now 
arrived from the boat-house Harriet took it upon herself to stem the 
stream of questions 

"Yes One of our students Not a good waterman Alarmed to think 
she had taken a canoe out alone Reckless Yes, we were afraid there 
might be an accident Wmd Strong current Yes No Quite against the 
rules ” (If there was going to be an inquest, other explanations might 
have to be made there. But not here Not now ) " Very unwise High 
spints Oh, yes Most unfortunate Taking risks . ” 

** She’ll do now,” said the constable 
He sat up and wiped the sweat from his eyes 

Brandy Blankets A melancholy little procession along the fields to the 
boat-house, but less melancholy than it might have been Then an orgy 
of telephomng Then the arrival of the doctor Then Harriet found her- 
self, suddenly shaking with nerves, being given whisky by some kindly 
person The patient was better The patient was quite all right The 
capable pohceznan and Miss Haydock and Miss Stevens were having 
their hands dressed, where the sharp weeds had slashed them to the bone. 

m 



People were talking and talking , Harnet hoped they were not taiiang 
foolishly 

“ Weil,” said the Dean m her ear, we are having a night ^ ” 

** Who*s with Miss Newland ^ ” 

Miss Edwards Fve warned her not to let the child say an/thing sf 
she can help it And Fve muzzled that nice policeman Accident, my 
dear, accident It’s quite ali right We’ve taken your cue You kept your 
head wonderfully Miss Stevens lost hers a bit, though Started to cry and 
talk about suicide I soon shut her up ” 

“ Damn * ” said Harnet “ W^hat did she want to do that for ^ 

“ What indeed ^ You’d think she wanted to make a scandal ” 

“ Somebody obviously does ” 

“ You don’t think Miss Stevens ^ She did her bit with the rescue- 

A^ork, you know ” 

“ Yes, I know. All right, Dean I don’t think I won’t tr> to think. I 
thought she and Miss Edwaids would have that boat over between 
them ” 

** Don’t let’s discuss it now Thank Heav’en the worst hasn’t happened 
The girl’s safe and that’s all that matteis What we’ve got to do now is 
to put the best face on it ” 

It was nearly five in the mormng when the rescuers, wearv and 
bandaged, sat once again in the Warden’s house Everybody was 
praising every Dod>“ else 

“ It was so clever of Miss Vane,” said the Dean “ to realise that the 
wretched child would go up to that particular place What a mercy that 
we arrived just when we did ” 

“ Fm not so sure about that,” said Harnet “ W^e may have done more 
harm than good Do you realise that it was only when she saw us coming 
that she made up her mind to do it ^ ” 

“ Do you mean she mightn’t have done it at all if we hadn’t gone after 
her > ” 

“ Difficult to say She was putting it off, I thmk What reaEy sent her 
in v/as that shout from the other boat Who shouted, by the way ^ ** 

I shouted,” said Miss Stevens “ I looked over my shoulder and saw 
her So I shouted ” 

“ What was she doing when you saw her ^ ” 

Standing up m the canoe ” 

** No, she wasn’t,” said Miss Edwards I looked round when you 
shouted, and she was just gettmg to her feet then ” 

“ You’re quite mistaken,” contradicted Miss Stevens I say she was 
f^t gr^eijng up when I saw her, and I shouted to stop her You couldn’t 
have seen past me.” 

** I saw perfectly plainly,” said Miss Edwards ** Miss Vane is quite 
nght It was when she heard the ahcyut that she got up ” 


m 



“ I know what I saw,” said the Bursar, obstinately 
“ It’s a pity you didn’t take somebody to cox,” said the Dean 
Nobody can see clearly what’s going on behind her back ” 

“ It is hardly necessary to argue about it,” said the Warden, a little 
sharply The tiagedy has been prevented, and that is all that matters 
I am exceedingly grateful to everybody ” 

“ I resent the suggestion,” said Miss Stevens, ” that I drove the unfor- 
tunate girl to destroy herself And as for saying that we ought not to have 
gone in search of her ” 

“ I never said that,” said Harnet, wearily “ I only said that z/'we had 
not gone it might not have happened But of course we had to go ” 

“ What does Newland say herself^ ” demanded the Dean 
Says, why couldn’t we leav'e her alone ^ ” replied Miss Edwards I 
told her not to be an inconsiderate little ass ” 

“ Poor child ! ” said Miss Shaw 

” If I were you,” said Miss Edwards, “ I shouldn’t be too soft with 
these people Bracing up is what does them good You let them talk too 
much about themselves ” 

“ But she didn’t talk to me,” said Miss Shaw “ I tiied very hard to 
make her ” 

“ They’d talk much more if you’d only lea\e them alone ” 

** I think we’d better all go to bed,” said Miss Martin 

“ What a mght,” said Hamet, as she rolled, dog-weary, between the 
sheets " What a gaudy night * ” Her memory, thrashing round her brain 
like a cat in a sack, brought up the images of Mr Pomfret and the pro- 
Proctor They seemed to belong to another existence 


CHAPTER XIII 

My sad hurt it shall releeve. 

When my thoughts I shall disclose, 
For thou canst not chuse but greeve. 
When I shall recount my woes , 
There is nothing to that fnend. 

To whose close uncranied breast. 

We our secret thoughts may send, 
And tnere safely let it rest , 

And thy faithfull counsell may 
My distressed case assist, 

Sad alBiction else may sway 
Me a woman as it list

“ You must see, * said Hariiet, “ that it’s impossible to go on like this 
You’ve got to call in expert help and risk the consequences Any scandal 
IS better than a suicide and an inquest ” 

‘‘ I think you are right,” said the Warden 

Only Miss Lydgate, the Dean and Miss Edwards sat with Dr Baring 
in the Warden’s sitting-room The biave pretence at confidence had been 
given up In the Senior Common Room, members averted their eyes 
from one another and set a guard upon their lips They were no longer 
angry ana suspicious They were afraid 

“ The girl’s parents are not likely to keep quiet about itj” went on 
Hamet, remorselessly “ If she had succeeded in drowmng herself^ we 
should have the police and the reporters m at this moment Next time, 
the attempt may come off ” 

** Next time ” began Miss Lydgate 

“ There will be a next time,” said Hamet “ Ard it may not be 
smcide , it may be open murder I told you at the begmning that I did 
not think the measures adequate I now sa/ that I refuse to take any 
further share in the responsibility I have tried, and 1 ha\e failed, every 
time ” 

“ What could the police do ^ ” asked Miss Edwards “ We did have 
them in once — about those thefts, you remember, Warden They made a 
great deal of fuss and arrested the wrong person It was a very trouble- 
some business ” 

” I don’t think the police are the right people at all,” said the Dean. 
Your idea was a firm of private detectives, wasn’t it ^ ” 

She turned to Harnet 

“ Yes , but if anybody else has anythmg better to suggest ” 

Nobody had any very helpful suggestion The discussion went on In 
the end : 

“ Miss Vane,” said the Warden, “ I thmk your idea is the best Will 
you get into connnumcation with these people ” 

“ Very well, Warden I will nng up the head of the firm.” 

“ You will use discretion.” 

“ Of course,” said Harnet She was becoming a httle impatient , the 
time for discretion seemed to her to be past “ If we call people in, we 
shall have to give them a free hand, you know,” she added 
This was obviously an unpalatable renunder, though its force had to 
be admitted Hamet could foresee endless hampering restnedons placed 
upon the investigators, and felt the difficulties that went with a divided 
authonty The police were answerable to nobody but themselves, but 
paid pnvate detectives were compelled to do more or less as they were 
told She looked at Dr Banng, and wondered whether Miss Ghmpson or 
any of her underhngs was capable of asserting herself against that 
formidable personality. 


197 



“ And now/* said the Dean, as she and Harnet crossed the quad 
together, ** I\e got to go and tackle the Newlands I’m mt looking for- 
ward to It They’ll be terribly upset, poor things He’s a very minoi civil 
servant, and their daughter’s career means everything to them Quite 
apart from the personal side of it, it’ll be a frightful blow if this rums her 

Schoob They’re very poor and hard-working, and so proud of her ” 

hliss Martin made a little despairing gesture, squared her shoulders 
and went to face her task 


Miss Hillyard, in her gown, was making for one of the lecture-rooms 
She looked hollow-eyed and desperate, Harriet thought Her glance shot 
from side to side, as though she were pursued 


From an open window on the ground floor of Queen Elizabeth came 
the voice of Miss Shaw, giving a coaching 

“ You might ha »e quoted abo from the essay De la Varntd You remem- 
ber the passage Je me sms couchd mills fots chez mot, imagmant qu'on me 
trahirait et assomemt cette nuit-ld, — ^his morbid preoccupation with the idea 
of death and his ” 

The academic machine was grmding on At the entrance leading to 
their offices, tne Bursar and Treasurer stood together, their hands full of 
papers They seemed to be discussing some question of finance Their 
glances were secretive and mutually hostile , they looked like sullen dogs, 
chained together and forced into a grumbling amity by the reprimand of 
their master 

Miss Pyke came down her staircase and passed them without a word 
Still without a word, she passed Harriet and turned along the plinth 
Her head was held high and defiantly Harriet went m and along to Miss 
Lydgate’s room Miss Lydgate, as she knew, was lecturing , she could use 
her telephone imdisturbed She put her call through to London 


A quarter of an hour later, she hung up the receiver with a sinking 
heart Why she should be surpnsed to learn that Miss Climpson was 
absent from Town “ engaged on a case ” she could not have said It 
seemed vaguely monstrous that this should be so , but it was so Would 
she like to speak to anyone else^ Hamet had asked for Miss Murchison, 
the only otlier member of the firm who was personally known to her 
Miss Murchison had left a year ago to be married Harnet felt this as 
almost a personal affront She did not like to pour all the detaib of the 
Shrewsbury affair into the ears of a complete stranger. She said she 
would write, rang off, and sat feeling cunously helpless 
It IS ail very well to take a firm line about things, and rush to the tde* 
198 



phone, determined to ** do something ” without delay ; other people do 
not sit with folded hands waiting upon the convenience even of our 
highly interesting and influential selves. Harriet laughed at her own 
annoyance. She had made up her mind to instant action, and now she 
was furious because a business firm had affairs of its own to attend to. 
Yet to wait any longer was impossible. The situation was becoming a 
nightmare. Faces had grown sly and distorted overnight ; eyes fearful ; 
the most innocent wor^ charged with suspicion. At any moment some 
new terror might break bounds and carry all before it. 

She was suddenly afraid of ail these women ; fmti miclusi^ fonks 
signati, they were availed in, sealed down, by walls and seals that shut her 
out. Sitting there in the clear light of morning, staring at the prosaic 
telephone on the desk, she knew the ancient dread of Artemis, moon- 
goddess, virgin-huntress, ’whose arrows are plagues and death. 

It struck her then as a fantastic idea that she should fly for help to 
another brood of spinsters ; even if she succeeded in getting hold of Miss 
Climpson, how was she to explain matters to that desiccated and elderly 
virgin ? The very sight of some of the poison letters would probably 
make her sick, and the whole trouble would be beyond her comprehen- 
sion. In this, Harriet did the lady less than justice ; Miss Climpson had 
seen many strange things in sixty-odd years of boarding-house life, and 
was as free from repressions and complexes as any human being could 
very well be. But in fact, the atmosphere of Shrewsbury was getting on 
Harriet’s nerves. What she wanted was someone tvith whom she did not 
need to mince her words, somebody who would neither show nor fed 
surprise at any manifestation of human eccentricity, somebody whom she 
knew and could trust. 

There were plenty of people in London — ^both men and women — to 
whom the discussion of sexual abnormaliti^ was a commonplace ; but 
most of them were very little to be trusted. They cultivated normality 
till it stood out of them all over in knobs, like the muscles upon profes- 
sional strong men, and scarcely looked normal at all. And they talked 
interminably and loudly. From their bouncing mental health ordinary 
ill-balanced mortals shrank in alarm. She ran over various names in her 
mind, but found none that would do. 

** The fact is,” said Harriet to the telephone, “ I don’t know whether 
I want a doctor or a detective. But I’ve got to have somebody.” 

She wished — and not for the first time — that she could have got hold 
of Peter Wimsey. Not, of course, that this was the kind of case he could 
very suitably have investigated himself ; but he would probably have 
known the right person. He at least would be surprised at nothing, 
shocked at nothing ; he had far too wide an experience of the world. 
And he was completely to be trusted. But he was not there. He had 
vanished from view at the very moment. when the Shrewsbury affair 
had first come to her notice ; it seemed almost pointed. Like Lord Saint- 

199 



Gfsoiige, she began to feel that Peter really had no nght to disappear just 
when he was wanted The fact that she had spent five years angniy 
refusing to contract further obhgations towards Peter Wimsev had no 
weight with her now , she would readily have contracted obligations 
towards the devil himself, if she could have been sure that the pnnce of 
darkness was a gentleman of Peter’s kidney But Peter was as far beyond 
reach as Lucifer 

Was he ^ There was the telephone at her elbow She could speak to 
Rome as easily as to London — though at a tnfle more expense It was 
probably only the financial modesty of the person whose income is all 
earned by work that made it seem more momentous to rmg somebody up 
across a contment than across a city At any rate, it could do no harm to 
fetch Peter’s last letter and find the telephone number of his hotel She 
went out qmckly, and encountered Miss de Vine 

Oh * ” said the Fellow I was coming to look for you I thought I 
had better show you this ” 

She held out a piece of paper , the sight of tne printed letters was 
odiously familiar 

YOUR TURN’S COMING 

“ It’s mce to be warned,” said Harriet, with a lightness she did not 
feel “ Where ^ when ? and how ’ ” 

** It fell out of one of the books I’m using,” said Miss de Vine, blink- 
ing behind her glasses at the questions, just now ” 

** When did you use the book last ^ ” 

That,” said Miss de Vme, blinking again, is the odd thing about 
It I didn’t Miss Hdlyard borrowed it last night, and Mrs Goodwin 
brought It back to me this mormng ” 

Considering the thmp Miss Hillyard had said about Mrs, Goodwin, 
Harriet was faintly surprised that she should have chosen her to run her 
errands But in certain circumstances the choice might, of course, be a 
wise one 

Are you sure the paper wasn’t there yesterday ^ ” 

** I don’t think it could have been I was referring to various pages, and 
I think I should have seen it ” 

Did you give it directly into Miss HiUyard’s own hands ^ ” 

“ No , I put It in her pigeon-hole before Hall ” 

** So that anybody might have got hold of it ” 

Oh, yes ” 

Exasperating Harriet took possession of the paper and passed on It 
was now not even clear against whom the threat was directed, much less 
from whom it came She fetched Peter’s letter, and discovered that in 
the interval she had made up her mind She had said she would rmg up 
the head of the firm , and so she would If he was not techmcally the 
head, he was certainly the brains of it She put the call through She did 
200 



not know how long it would take, but left instructions at the Lodge that 
when It came she was to be searched for and found without fail She felt 
abommably restless 


The next piece of news was that a violent quarrel had taken olace 
between Miss Shaw and J^liss Stevens, who were normally the closest of 
friends Miss Shaw, having heard the full story of the previous night’s 
adventure, had accused Miss Stevens of fnghtemng Miss Newland into 
the river , Miss Stevens had in her turn accused Miss Shaw of deliberately 
playing on the girl’s feelings, so as to work her up into a state of ner\es, 


The next disturber of the peace was Miss Allison As Harriet had 
discovered the previous term, Miss Allison had a way of passing on to 
people the things other people had said of them In a spirit of candour 
she had now chosen to pass on to Mrs Goodwin the hints throwm out by 
Miss Hiilyard Mrs Goodwin had tackled Miss Hillyard about it , and 
there had been a most unpleasant scene, m which Miss Allison, the Dean 
and poor little Miss Chilpenc, who had been drawn into the discussion 
by malignant chance, took sides with Mrs Goodwin against Miss Pyke 
and Miss Burrows, who, though they thought Miss Hillyard had spoken 
ill-ad\isedly, resented any aspersions cast against the unmarned state as 
such This unpleasantness took place m the Fellows’ Garden. 

Finally, Miss Allison had further inflamed the situation by passing on 
a vivid account of the matter to Miss Barton, who had gone away mdig- 
nantly to tell Miss Lydgate and Miss de Vine exactly what she thought 
of the psychology both of Miss Hiilyard and ]Miss Allison 
It was not an agreeable mormng. 


Between the married (or about-to-be-mamed) and the unmarried, 
Harriet felt herself to be like ^Esop’s bat between the birds and beasts , 
an odd result, she felt, of having sown her wild oats in public Lxmch was 
a strained meal She came into Hall rather late, to find that the High 
Table had sorted itself out into opposing camps, with Miss Hillyard at 
one end and Mrs Goodwin at the other She found an empty chair 
between Miss de Vine and Miss Stevens, and amused herself by drawing 
them and Miss Allison, who was next to Miss de Vine on the other side, 
into a discussion of currency and mfiation She knew nothing of the sub- 
ject, but they, naturally knew a good deal, and her tact was rewarded 
Conversation spread , the table presented a less sullen front to the 
assembled students and Miss Lydgate beamed approval Things were 
moving nicely when a scout, leamng between Miss Allison and Miss de 
Vme, murmured a message 
7 * 


SOI 



From Rome ^ ” said Miss de Vine ‘‘ Who can that be, I wonder ^ ’* 
Telephoning from Rome ^ said Miss Allison, in piercing accents 
Oh, one of your correspondents, I suppose He must be better off than 
most histonans ” 

** I think it’s for me,” said Harriet, and turned to the scout Are you 
sure they said de Vine and not Vane ^ ” 

The scout was not very sure. 

** If you’re expecting it, it must be for >ou,” said Miss de Vine Miss 
Ailison made some rather sharp observation about writers of mterna- 
tional celebrity and Harriet left the table, flushing uncomfortably and 
angry with herself for doing so 

As she went down to the public call-box in Queen Elizabeth, to which 
the call had been put through, she tried to arrange in her own mind what 
to say A brief sentence of apology, another brief sentence of explanation , 
and a lequest for advice , mto whose hands should the case be put ^ 
There was, surely, nothing difficult about that 
The voice from Rome spoke English very well It did not think Lord 
Peter Wimsey was in the hotel, but would inquire A pause, during which 
she could hear feet passing to and fro on the other side of the continent 
Then the voice again, suave and apologetic 
** His lordship left Rome three days ago ” 

Oh * Did they know for what destination ^ 

They would inqmre Another pause, and voices speaking Italian Then 
the same voice again 
** His lordship left for Warsaw ” 

“ Oh ’ Thank you very much ” 

And that was that 

At the thought of ringmg up the British Embassy at Warsaw, her 
heart failed her She replaced the receiver and went upstairs again She 
did not seem to have gained very much by takmg a firm line 


Fnday afternoon Crises always, thought Harriet, occurred at the 
week-end, when there were no posts If she wrote now to London and 
they replied by return, she would still, in all probability, be able to take 
no action till Monday If she wrote to Peter, there imght be an Air-Mail 
—but suppose he wasn’t at Warsaw after all. He might by now have 
gone on to Bucharest or Berlin Could she possibly ring up the Foreign 
Oflice and demand to know his whereabouts ^ Because, if the letter got 
to him over the week-end and he wired a reply, she would not be losing 
so very much time She was not sure if she would be very good at dealing 
with the Foreign Office Was there anybody who could ? How about the 
Hon Freddy^ 

It took a little time to locate Freddy Arbuthnot, but eventually she 
ran him down, by ’phone, at an oflSce m Throgmorton Street He was 



definitely helpful He had no idea where old Peter was, but he would 
take steps to find out, and if she liked to send a letter care of him (Freddy) 
he would see that it was forwarded on at the earliest possible moment 
No trouble at all Charmed to be of use 
So the letter was written, and despatched so as to reach Town first post 
on the Saturday mormng It contamed a brief outline of the case, and 
finished up 

“ Can you tell me whether you think Miss Climpson*s people could 
handle it ^ And who, m her absence, is the most competent person 
there ^ Or, if not, can you suggest anybody else I could ask ? Perhaps 
It should be a psychologist and not a detective I know that anybody 
you recommend will be trustworthy Would you mind wiring as soon 
as you get this ^ I should be immensely grateful We are all getting 
rather worked up, and Tm afraid something drastic may happen if we 
don’t cope with it quickly ” 

She hoped that last sentence did not sound as pamcky as she felt 

“ I rang up your hotel in Rome and they said you had gone on to 
Warsaw As I don’t know where you may be bv tins time, I’m getting 
Mr Arbuthnot to forward this through the Foreign Office ” 

That sounded faintly reproachful, but it couldn’t be helped What she 
really wanted to say was, “ I wish to God you were here and could tell me 
what to do ” , but she felt that that xmght make him feel uncomfortable, 
since he obviously couldn’t be there Still, it could do no harm to ask 
** How soon do you think you will be back m England ^ ” And with this 
addition, the letter was finished and posted 


** And to put the hd on thmgs,” said the Dean, “ there’s this man 
coming to dinner ” 

“ This man ” was Dr Noel Threep, a very worthy and important man, 
a Fellow of a distinguished college and a member of the Council by which 
Shrewsbury was governed Fnends and benefactors of this kind were not 
infrequently entertained m College, and as a rule the High Table was 
glad of their presence But the moment was scarcely auspicious However, 
the engagement had been made early in the term, and it was quite 
impossible to put Dr Threep off Harriet said she thought his visit might 
be a good thing, and help to keep the mmds of the S^C R off their 
troubles 

** We’ll hope so,” said the Dean “ He’s a very nice man, and talks 
very interestingly He’s a political economist,” 

“ Hard-boiled or soft-boiled ? ” 

” Hard, I think ” 

This question had no reference to Dr Threep’s pohtics or economics, 
but only to his shirt-front Harriet and the Dean had begun to collect 

ao3 



shirt-fronts Miss Chitpenc’s * young man had started the collection 
He was extremely tall and thm and rather hollow-chested , by way of 
emphasising this latter defect, he always woie a soft pleated dress-shirt, 
which made him look (according to the Dean) like the scooped-out rind 
of a melon By way of contrast, there had been an eminent and ample 
professor of chemistry — a visitor from another umversity — who had 
turned up in a front of intense rigidity, which stood out before him like 
the chest of a pouter pigeon, bulging out of all control and displaying a 
large area of the parent shirt at either side A thud vanety of shirt fairly 
common among tihe learned was that which escaped from the centre stud 
and gaped m the middle , and one never-to-be-forgotten happy day a 
popular poet had arrived to give a lecture on his methods of composition 
and the future of poetry, whereby, at every gesticulation (and he had 
used a great many) his waistcoat had leapt m the air, allowing a line of 
shirt, adorned with a little tab, to peep out, rabbit-hke, over the waist- 
line of the confimng trouser On this occasion, Harriet and the Dean had 
disgraced themselves badly 

Dr Threep was a large, agreeable, talkative person, who at first sight 
appeared to present no loophole for sartorial cnticism But he had not 
been seated at table three mmutes before Hamet realised that he was 
doomed to form one of the most notable additions to the collection For 
he popped When he bent over his plate, when he turned to pass the 
mustard, when he courteously inclined himself to catch what his neigh- 
bour was saymg, his shirt-front exploded with a merry httle report like 
the opening of ginger-beer The clamour m Hall seemed louder than 
usual that night, so that the poppmgs were inaudible beyond a few places 
to nght and left of him , but the Warden and the Dean, who sat beside 
him, heard them, and Harriet, sitting opposite, heard them , she dared 
not catch the Dean’s eye Dr Threep was too well-bred, or perhaps too 
much embarrassed, to allude to the matter , he talked on imperturbably, 
raising his voice more and more to be heard above the din of the under- 
graduates The Warden was frowmng 
« — ^the excellent relations between the Women’s Colleges and the 

University,” said Dr Threep All the same ” 

The Warden summoned a scout, who presently went dowm to the 
Jumor High and thence to the other tables, with the usual message 
** The Warden’s compliments, and she would be obliged if there could 
be rather less noise.” 

** I beg your pardon, Dr Threep I didn’t quite catch ” 

** Ail the same,” repeated Dr Threep, with a polite bend and pop, 
** It IS curious to see how traces of the old prejudice linger Only yesterday 
the Vice-Chancellor showed me a remarkably vulgar anonymous letter 
sent to him that very morning . . ” 

The noise in Hall was dying down gradually , it was like a lull in the 
intervals of a storm 
^204 



making the most absurd accusations — oddiy enough against 
your own Semor Common Room m particular Accusations of murder, of 
ail things The Vice-Chancellor . ** 

Harriet missed the next few words , she was watching how, as Dr 
Threep’s voice rang out m the comparative quiet, the heads at the High 
Table jerked towards him, as though pulled by wires 

pasted on paper — quite ingemous I saxd, ‘ My dear Mr- Vice- 
Chancellor, I doubt whether the police can do much , it is probablv the 
work of some harmless crank * But is it not curious that such peculiar 
delusions should exist — and persvA — at this day ^ ” 

“ Very curious indeed,” said the Warden, with stiff lips 
“ So I advnsed against police mterference — ^for the moment, at any 
rate But I said I would put the matter before you, since Shrev sbur> was 
particularly mentioned I defer, of course, to >our opimon ” 

The dons sat spell-bound , and in that moment, Dr Threep bowing 
to the Warden’s decision, popped — with so loud and v^^olent an explosion 
that It resounded from end to end of the table, and the major embar- 
rassment was swallowed up in the mmoi Miss Chilpenc suddenly broke 
out into a spasm of high, nen^ous laughter 
How dinner ended, Harriet could never properly recall Dr Threep 
went over to have coffee with the Warden, and Harnet found herself m 
the Dean’s room, helpless between mirth and alarm 
“ It’s really very serious,” said Miss Martin 

” Hornbly ‘ I said to the Vice-Chancellor ’ ” 

« Pop 1 ” 

“ No , but honestly, what are we to do about it ^ 

” I defer to your opimon ” 

Pop » ” 

“ I can’t imagme what makes shirts do that Can you ^ ” 

** I’ve no idea And I meant to be so clever this evemng Here, said I, 
is a Man come among us , I will watcJti everybody’s reactions — and then 
It all went Pop * ” 

“ It’s no good watching reactions to Dr Threep,” said the Dean 
“ Everyone’s too used to him And anyhow, he has half a dozen children 
But It’s gomg to be very awkward if the Vice-Chancellor ” 

“Very” 

Saturday dawned dull and lowering 
** I beheve it’s gomg to thunder,” said Miss Allison 
“ Rather early m the year for that,” said Miss Hiilyard 
“ Not at all,” retorted Mrs Goodwin , “ I’ve known plenty of 
thunderstorms in May ” 

“ There is certainly something electrical in the atmosphere,” said Miss 
Lydgate 

“ I agree with you,” said Miss Barton.

Harnet had slept badly She had, in fact, been walking about College 
half the night, a prey to imaginary alarms When at length she had gone 
to bed, she had had the tiresome dream about trying to catch a tram, 
hampered all the time by a quantity of luggage which she strove vainly 
to pack m misty and unmanageable suit-cases In the morning, she 
struggled desperately with the proofs of Miss Lydgate’s chapter on 
Gerard Manley Hopkins, finding it as unmanageable as the suit-cases 
and very nearly as misty In the mtervals of disentangling the poet’s own 
system of sprung, counterpoint and logaoedic rhythm, with its rove-over 
Imes and outrides, from Miss Lydgate’s rival system of scansion (which 
required five alphabets and a senes of pothooks for its expression), she 
wondered whether Freddy Arbuthnot had succeeded in doing what he 
had promised and whether she ought to leave it at that or do something 
else in which case, what ^ In the afternoon, she could bear herself no 
longer and set out, under a threatemng sky, to wander about Oxford, 
and walk herself, if possible, into exhaustion She started up the High, 
pausing for a few moments to stare into the window of an Antique shop , 
there was a set of carved ivory chessmen there, for which she had con- 
ceived an unreasonable affection She even played with the idea of going 
boldly m and buymg them , but she knew they would cost too much 
They were Chinese, and each piece was a complicated nest of little revol- 
ving balls, delicate as fine lace It would be jolly to handle them, but 
idiotic to buy them , she was not even a good chess-player, and in any 
case, one couldn’t play chess comfortably with pieces like that She put 
temptation aside and moved on There was a shop full of wooden objects 
embellished with the painted shields of colleges book-ends, match- 
stands, pens shaped like oars and hombly top-heavy, cigarette-boxes, 
ink-pots and even powder-compacts Did it add a zest to facial repairs to 
have them watched over by the hons of Onel or the martlets of Worces- 
ter ^ To be reminded durmg the process that one had a betrothed among 
the topping stags of Jesus or a brother nourished by the pious pehcan 
of Corpus ^ She crossed the street before she came to Queen’s (for Mr 
Pomfict might conceivably pop out of the gate, and she was rather 
avoiding an encounter with Pomfret) and went on up the other side 

Books and pmts— fasematmg at most times, but insufficiently exciting 
to hold her attention Robes and gowns, colourful, but too academic for 
her mood A chemist’s shop. A stationer’s, with more college bnc-a-brac, 
this time in glass and pottery A tobacconist’s, with more coats of arms, 
on ash-trays and tobacco-jars A jeweller’s, with college arms on spoons 
and brooches and napkin-rmgs She grew weary of college arms and 
turned down a side-street mto Merton Street In this untouched and 
cobbled thoroughfare there should be peace, if anywhere But peace is in 
the mind, and not in streets, however old and beautiful She passed 
through the iron gate mto Merton Grove, and so, crossing over Dead 
Man’s Walk, into the Broad Walk of Ghnst Church and along this and 
206 



round to the towing path where the New Gut meets the Isis And there 
to her horror, she was hailed by a well-known voice Here, by special 
interposition of all the powers of evil, was Ivliss Schuster-Slatt, wnose 
presence m Oxford she had till that moment mercifully forgotten, con- 
voying a partv of American visitors, all eager for information M»ss Vane 
was the very person to tell them everything Did she know which of tne«e 
barges belonged to which college^ Were those cute little blue-and-goid 
heads gniSins or phoenixes and we» e there three of them to symbolise the 
Trinity or was that just accident ^ Were those the Magdalen lilies ? If so, 
why was there the initial W ” painted all round the barge and what did 
it stand for ^ Why did Pembroke have the English rose and the Scotch 
thistle at the top of the shield ^ Were the roses of New College English 
roses, too ^ Why was it called New when it was so old, and why mustn’t 
you call It “ New but always New College ” ^ Oh * look, Saaie — 
are those geese flying across ^ Sw^ans ^ How interesting ^ Were there 
many swans on the nver ^ Was it true that all the swans in England 
belonged to the King ^ Was that a swan on that barge ^ Oh, an eagle 
Why did some barges have figure-heads and some not ^ Did the boys ever 
have tea-parties on the barges ? Gould Miss Vane explain about diose 
bumping races, because nobody had been able to understana from 
Sadie’s description Was that the University barge ^ Oh, the University 
College barge Was the University College the place w^here all the classes 
were held ^ 

And so forth and so on — all along the towing path, all the way up the 
long avenue to the Meadow Buil^ngs and all the wa> round Chnst 
Church, from Hall to Kitchen, from Cathedral to Libraiy^, from Mertrury 
to Great Tom, while all the time the skv brooded lower and the weather 
became more oppressive, until Hamet, who had started out feeling as 
though her skiill were stuffed with wool, ended up with a raging 
headache 


The storm held off till after Hail, except for threatenings and grumb- 
lings of thunder At lo o’clock the first great flash went across the sky 
like a searchlight, picking out roof and tree-top violet-blue against the 
blackness, and followed by a clap that shook the walls Harriet flung 
her wmdow open and leaned out There was a sweet smell of approach- 
ing ram Another flash and crash , a swuft gust of wind , and then the 
swish and rush of falhng water, the gargle of overflowing gutters, and 
peace

*Tt was a good storm,” said the Dean 

” First-class,” said the Bursar, dryly, “ for those that like it and donh 
have to cope with those that don’t The scouts’ quarters were a pande- 
momum , I had to go over There was Carrie in hysteucs, and Cook 
thinkmg her last hour had come, and Annie shrieking to Heaven that her 
darlmg children would be temfied and wanting to rush off to Headmgton 

then and there to comfort them ” 

“ I wonder you didn’t send her there at once in the best car available,” 
put in Miss Hillyard in sarcastic tones 

— ^and one of the kitchen-maids having an outbreak of religious 
blues,” went on Miss Stevens, and confessing her sms to an adxmiing 
circle I can’t think why people have so little self-control ” 

“ I’m horribly afraid of thunder,” said Miss Chilpenc 
** The wretched Newland was all upset again,” said the Dean The 
Infirmanan was quite frightened about her Said the Infirmary maid was 
hidmg m the linen-cupboard and she didn’t like to be left alone with 
Newland. However, Miss Shaw obhgmgly coped ” 

” Who were the four students who were dancing in the quad in 
bathing-dresses ^ ” inquired Miss Pyke “ They had quite a ritual 

appearance I was reminded of the ceremomal dances of the ” 

” I was afraid the beeches were going to be struck,” said Miss Burrows 
** I sometimes wonder whether it’s safe to have them so near the 

buildings If they came dowm ” 

** There’s a bad leak m my ceiling, Bursar,” said Mrs Goodwin “ The 
ram came in like a water-spout— -just over my bed I had to move all the 

furmture, and the carpet is quite ” 

Anyhow,” repeated the Dean, ‘‘ it was a good storm, and it’® 
cleared the air Look at it Could anybody want a better and brighter 
Sunday mommg ^ ” 

208 



Harriet nodded The sun was bnlhant on the wet grass and the wind 
blew fresh and cool 

** It’s taken my headache away, thank goodness ^ I’d like to do some- 
thing calm and cheerful and thoroughly Oxoman Isn’t everything a 
lovely colour ^ Like the blues and scarlets and greens in an illuminated 
missal * ” 

** I’ll tell you what we’ll do,” said the Dean, brightly “ We’ll toddle 
along like two good little people and hear the University Sermon I can’t 
think of anything more soothingly normal and acadeimc than that And 
Dr Armstrong’s preaching He’s always interesting ” 

The University Sermon ^ ” said Hariiet, amused Weil, that’s the 
last thing I should have thoaghi of for myself But it’s an idea , definitely 
an idea We’ll go ” 


Yes , the Dean was right , here was the great Anglican compromise 
at Its most soothmg and ceremonial The solemn procession of doctors in 
hood and habit , the Vice-Chancellor bowing to the preacher, and the 
bedels tripping before them , the throng of black gowns and the decorous 
gaiety of the summer-frocked WiVes of dons , the hymn and the bidding- 
prayer , the gowned and hooded preacher austere m cassock and bands , 
the quiet discourse delivered m a thin, clear, scholarly voice, and dealing 
gently with the relations of the Christian philosophy to atomic physics 
Here were the Umversities and the Church of England kissing one 
another in nghteousness and peace, like the angels m a Botticelli 
Nativity very exquisitely robed, very cheerful m a senous kind of way, 
a little mannered, a litde conscious of theur fine mutual courtesy Here, 
Without heat, they could discuss their common problem, agreeing 
pleasantly or pleasantly agreeing to differ Of tne grotesque and ugly 
devil-shapes sprawling at the foot of the picture these angels had no woid 
to say W^at solution could either of them produce, if challenged, for the 
Shrewsbury problem ^ Other bodies would be bolder the Church of 
Rome would have its answer, smooth, competent and expenenced , the 
queer, bittgrly-jarnng sects of the New Psychology would ha^e another, 
ugly, awkward, tentative and applied with a passionate expenmentahsm 
It was entertaimng to imagine a Freudian University *ndissolubly 
wedded to a Romafn Establishment they certainly would not live so 
harmomouslv together as the Angbcan Church a’^d the Scj-ooI of 
Litterae Humaniores But it was delightful to believe, if onl/ for an hour, 
that all human difficulties could be dealt with in this detached arc 
amiable spint “ The Umveraity is a Paradise ” — true, but — then saw I 
that there was a way to hell even from the gates of Heaven ’ 


The blessing was given , the voluntary rolled out — something fugal 

2C9 



and pre-Bach , the procession re-formed and dispersed again, passing 
out south and north , the congregation rose to their feet and began to 
stream away in an orderly disorder The Dean, who was fond of early 
fugues, remained quietly in her place and Harriet sat dreamily beside 
her, with eyes fixed on the softly-tmted samts in the rood-screen At 
length they both rose and made their way to the door A mild, clear gust 
of wind met them as they passed between the twisted columns of Dr 
Owen*s porch, makmg the Dean clutch at the peak of her rebellious cap 
and bellying out their gowns into wide arcs and volutes The sky, between 
pillow and pillow of rounded cloud, was the pale and transparent blue 
of aquamarine 

Standing at the corner of Cat Street was a group of gowns, chatting 
with animation — among them, two Fellows of All Souls and a dignified 
figure which Harriet recognised as that of the Mastei of Bailiol Beside 
him was another MA who, as Harriet and the Dean went by, 
conversing of counterpoint, turned suddenly and lifted his mortar-board 
For a long moment, Harnet simply could not believe her eyes Peter 
Wimsey Peter, of all people Peter, who was supposed to be m Warsaw, 
planted placidly in the High as though he had grown tliere from the 
begmnmg Peter, wearing cap and gown hke any orthodox Master of 
Arts, presenting' every appearance of havmg piously attended the Um- 
versity Sermon, and now talking mild academic shop with two Fellows of 
All Souls and the Master of Balliol. 

“ And why not ^ ** thought Harnet, after the first second of shock 
He IS a Master of Arts He was at Balliol Why shouldn’t he talk to tlie 
Master if he likes ^ But how did he get here ^ And why ^ And when did 
he come ^ And why didn’t he let me know ^ ” 

She found herself confusedly receiving introductions and presenting 
Lord Peter to the Dean 

I rang up yesterday from Town,” Wimsey was saying, “ but you 
were out ” And then more explanations — something about flying over 
from Warsaw, and my nephew at the House,” and ** the Master’s kind 
hospitality,” and sending a note round to College Then, out of the 
jumble of polite nothings, a sentence she grasped clearly 

“ If you are free and m College during the next half-hour or so, may 
I come round and look you up ^ ” 

“ Yes, do,” said Harriet, lamely, “ that would be delightful ” She 
pulled herself together “ I suppose it’s no good asking you to lunch ^ ” 
It appeared that he was lunchmg with the Master, and that one of the 
Ail Souls men was lunching also In fact, a little lunch-party with, she 
gathered, some kind of historical basis, with mention of somebody’s 
article for the Proceedings of Something or Other, which Wimsey was 
going to step into All Souls and look at — it won’t take you ten minutes,” 
and references to the prmtmg and distnbution of Reformation polemical 
pamphlets— to Wimsey’s expert knowledge— to the other man’s expert 



knowledge — and to the inexpert pretence at knowledge of some histonan 
fzom another umverSity 

Then the whole group broke up The Master raised his cap and drifted 
away, leminding Wxmsey and the histonan that lunch would be at i 15 , 
Peter said sometning to Hariiet about being “ round in Uventy mmutes,” 
and then vanished with the two Fellows into All Souls, and Harriet ana 
the Dean were walking together again 
“ Well * ” said the Dean, “ so that’s the man 
** Yes,” said Harriet weakly, “ that’s him ” 

“ My dear, he’s perfectly charming You never said he was coming to 
Oxford ” 

“ I didn’t knov/ I thought he was in Warsaw I knew he was supposed 
to be coming up some time this term to see his nephew, but Fd no idea he 
could get aw^ay so soon As a matter of fact, I wanted to ask him — only I 

don’t suppose he could ha\e got my letter ” 

She felt that her efforts at explanation were only darkening counsel 
In the end she made a clean breast of the whole affair to the Dean 
“ I don’t know whether he got my letter and know^s already, or 
whether, if he doesn’t, I ought to tell him I know he’s absolutely safe 
But whether the Warden and the SCR — I didn’t expect him to turn 
up like this ” 

“ I should think it was the wasest thing you could have done,” sa-d 
Miss Martin “ I shouldn’t say too much at College Bring him along, if 
he’ll come, and let him turn the whole lot of us inside out A man wntn 
manners hke that could twist the whole High Table round his little 
finger What a mercy he’s a historian — that will put him on the ngh+ 
side of Miss Hiliyard ” 

“ I never thought of him as a histonan ” 

W’dl, he took a First, anyway didn’t you know ^ ” 

She had not known She had not even troubled to wonder She had 
never consciously connected Wimsey and Oxford m her mind Thjus was 
the Foreign Office business all over agam If he had realised her thought- 
lessness It must have hurt him She saw herself as a monster of callou* 
ingratitude 

“ I’m told he was looked upon as one of the ablest scholars of his year,” 
pursued the Dean “ A L Smith thought highly of him It’s a pity, in a 
way, he didn’t stick to History — ^but naturally, his chief interests wouldn’t 
be acadeimc ” 

** No,” said Hamet 

So the Dean had been making inqmnes Naturally, she would 
Probably the whole SCR could by now give her detailed information 
about Wimsey’s Umversity career That was comprehensible enough 
they thought along those hnes But she herself might surely have found 
the energy for two minutes’ study of the Calendar 
” Where shall I put him when he comes ^ I suppose if I take him off to 

211 



my own room it will set a bad example to the students And it is a bit 
cramped ” 

“ You can have my sitting-room Much better than any of the public 
rooms, if you’re going to discuss this beastly business I wonder if he did 
get that letter Perhaps the eager interest behind that penetrating eye 
was due to his suspicions of me And I put it all down to my personal 
fascination ’ The man’s dangerous, though he doesn’t look it ” 

That’s why he’s dangerous But if he read my letter, he’ll know that 
It isn’t you ” 


Some minor confusions were cleared up when they reached College 
and found a note from Peter m Harriet’s pigeon-hole It explained that 
he had reached London early on Saturday afternoon and found Harriet’s 
letter waiting for him at the Foreign Office “ I tried to ring you, but 
left no name, as I did not know whether you wanted me to appear per- 
sonally in this matter ” He had been engaged m London that afternoon, 
motored to Oxford for dinner, been captured by some Balhol friends and 
kindly mvited by the Master to stay the night, and would call “ some 
time to-moirow ” m the hope of finding her m 


So she waited in the Dean’s room, idly watching the summer sun play 
through the branches of the plane-tree m the New Qiaad and make a 
dancmg pattern upon the phnth, until she heard his knock When she 
said “ Gome m ’ ” the commonplace formula seemed to take on a start- 
ling sigmficance For good or evil, she had called m somethmg explosive 
from the outside world to break up the ordered tranquiUity of the place , 
she had sold the breach to an alien force , she had sided with London 
against Oxford and with the world against the cloister 
But when he entered, she knew that the image had been a false one He 
came into the qmet room as though he belonged there, and had never 
belonged to any other place 

“ Hullo — ^uUo * ” he said, with a faint echo of the old, flippant manner 
Then he stripped off his gown and tossed it on the couch beside her own, 
laying his mortar-board on the table 
“ I foimd your note when I got back So you did get my letter ? ” 

“ Yes, I’m sorry you should have had all this bother It seemed to me, 
as I was coming to Oxford m any case, I had better push along and see 
you I meant to come round yesterday evemng, but I got tied up with 
people — and I thought perhaps I had better announce myself first ” 

It was good of you to come Sit down ” 

She pulled an arm-chair forward, and he dropped mto it rather 
heavily. She noticed, with a cunous little pack of anxiety, how the clear 
light picked out the angles of the skull on jaw and temple, 
saa 



** Peter * You look tired to death What have you been doing with 
yourself^ ** 

Talking/’ he said, discontentedly “ Words, w'ords, words Ail these 
interminable weeks Fm the professional funny man of the Foreign 
Office You didn’t know that ^ Well, I am Not often, but waitmg in the 
wings if wanted Some turn goes wrong — some Under-Secretary’s 
secretary with small discretion and less French uses an ill-considered 
phrase m an after-dinner speech, and they send on the patter-comedian 
to talk the house into a good humour again I take people out to lunch 
and tell them funny stones and work them up to mellowing point God ^ 
what a game ® ” 

I didn’t know' this, Peter I’ve just discovered that I’ve been too 
selfish even to try and know anything But it isn’t like you to sound so 

dreadfully discouraged You look ” 

“ Spare me, Harriet Don’t say I’m gcttmg to look m> age That won’t 
do An eternal childishness is my one diplomatic asset ” 

“ You only look as though you hadn’t slept for weeks ” 

“ I’m not sure that I have, now you mention it I thought — at one 
point we all thought — something might be going to happen All the old, 
filthy uproar I got as far as saying to Bunter one night ‘ It’s coming , 
It’s here , back to the Army again, sergeant * But in the end, you 
know, It made a noise like a hoop and rolled away — for the moment ” 

“ Thanks to the comic cross-talk ^ ” 

“ Oh, no Great Scott, no Mine was a very tnvial affair Slight 
frontier skirmish Don’t get it into your head that I’m the man who saved 
the Empire ” 

“Then who did 

“ Dunno Nobody know's Nobody ever does know, for certain The 
old bus wobbles one way, and you think, ‘ That’s done it ’ ! and then it 
wobbles the other way and you think, * Ail serene ’ , and then, one day, 
It wobbles over too far and you’re m the soup and can’t remember how 
you got there ” 

“ That’s what we’re all afraid of, mside ourselves ” 

“ Yes It terrifies me It’s a relief to get back and find you here — ^and 
all tins going on as it used to do Here’s where the real things are done, 
Han let — only those bunglers out there will keep quiet and let it go on 
God ’ how I loathe haste and violence and all that ghastly, shppery 
cleverness Unsound, unschoiarly, insincere — nothing but propaganda 
special pleading and ‘what do we get out of this^’ No time, no 
peace, no silence , nothing but conferences and nev/spapers and public 
speeches till one can’t hear one’s seif think If only one could root 

one’s seif m here among the grass and stones and do something worth 
doing, even if it was only restoring a lost breathing for the love of the job 
and nothing else ” 

She was astonished to hear him speak wnth so much passion 

ai3 



“ But Peter, you’re sa^ang exactly what I’ve been feeling all tins time 
But can it be done ^ ” 

** No , It can’t be done Though there are moments when one comes 
back and thunks it might ” 

“ * Ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therem, and 
ye shall find rest for your souls ’ ” 

Yes,” said he bitterly, “ and it goes on ‘ But they said we will not 
walk therem ’ Rest ^ I had forgotten there was such a word ” 

“ So had I ” 

They sat silent foi a few minutes Wimsey offered her his cigarette-case 
and struck a match for them both 

“ Peter, it’s queer w^e should sit here and talk like this Do you remem- 
ber that horrible time at Wilvercombe when we could find nothing to 
throw at one another but cheap wit and spiteful remarks ^ At least, I was 
spiteful you never weie ” 

“ It was the watering-place atmosphere,” said Wimsey “ One is 
always vulgar at watering-places It is the one haunting terror of my life 
that some day some perfeedy irresistible peach of a problem will blossom 
out at Bnghton or Blackpool, and that I shall be weak-rmnded enough 
to go and meddle with it ” The laughter had come back to his voice and 
his eyes were tranquil “ Thank Heaven, it’s extremely difficult to be 
cheap in Oxford — after one’s second year, at any rate Which remmds me 
that I haven’t yet properly thanked you for bemg so kind to Saint- 
George ” 

“ Have you seen him yet ^ ” 

“ No , I have threatened to descend on him on Monday, and show 
him a damned disinhenting countenance He has gone off somewhere 
to-day with a party of fhends I know what that means He’s getting 
thoroughly spoilt ” 

Well, Peter, you can’t wonder He’s ternbly good-lookmg ” 

“ He’s a precocious little monkey,” said his uncle, without enthusiasm 

Though I can’t blame him for that , it runs m the blood But it’s 
charactenstic of his impudence that he should have gate-crashed your 
acquaintance, after you had firmly refused to meet any of my 
people ” 

I found him for myself, you see, Peter ” 

** Literally, or so he says I gather that he nearly knocked you down, 
damaged your property and generally made a nuisance of himself, and 
that you instantly conduded he must be some relation to me.” 

“ That’s — If he said that, you know better than to beheve it But I 
couldn’t very well miss the likeness ” 

” Yet people have been known to speak slightingly of my personal 
appearance * I congratulate you on a perception worthy of Sherlock 
Holmes at his kc«iest ” 

It amused and touched her to discover this childish streak of vani^ m 
ai4 



him But she knew that he would see through her at once if she tned to 
pander to it by saying anything more fiattering tiian the trutn 

** I recognised the voice before I looked at him at all Ard ne has vour 
hands , I shouldn’t think anybody has ever spoken '^iigntirgjL/ aDou+ 
those ” 

** Confound it, Harnet ^ My one really shameful wea cress M/ mos’' 
jealously guarded bit of personal conceit Dragged into Jie hght of day 
and remoiselessly exposed I am idiotically proud of naming innemted 
the Wimsey hands My brother and my sister both missea «rem, but ihev 
go back m the fanuiy portraits for three hundred years ” K*s face clodded 
for a moment I wonder ail the strength hasn’t been bred out of them by 
this time , our sands are running down fast Harriet, will \Cti come witn 
me one day to Denver and see the place before the new ci\ risauon grows 
in on It hke the jungle^ I don’t want to go all Gaiswoidi\ aooat it 
They’ll tell you I don’t care a damn for the who^e oatht and I don’t 
know that I do But I was born there, and I shall be sorry if I ii\e to see 
the land sold for ribbon-bmlding and the Hall turned o\er to a 
Hollywood Colour-Talkie king ” 

** Lord Saint-George wouldn’t do that, would he ^ ’ 

I don’t know, Harriet Why shouldn’t he ^ Our kird of s'low' xS dead 
and done for What the hell good does it do anybody these days ^ Bui 
he may care more than he thinks he does ” 

“ You care, don’t you, Peter ^ ” 

“ It’s very easy for me to care, because I’m not called ^pon to do a 
hand’s turn in the matter I am the usual middle-aged prig, witii an 
admirable talent for binding heavy burdens and laving them on other 
men’s shoulders Don’t think I envy my nephew his job I’a rather hve 
at peace and lay my bones in the earth Only I have a cursed hanker- 
ing after certain musty old values, which I’m coward enough to deny, 
like my namesake of the Gospels I never go home if I can help it, and 
I avoid coming here , the cocks crow too long and too loudi r ” 

** Peter, I’d no idea you felt hke that I’d hke to see your nome ” 

“ Would you ^ Then we’ll go, one of these days I won’t irflict the 
family on you — though I think you’d hke my Mother But w e’ll cnoose a 
time when they’re all away— except a dozen or so harmless dukes in the 
family vault All embalmed, poor devils, to linger on dustily to the Day 
of Judgment. Typical, isn’t it, of a family tradition that it won’t even let 
you rot ” 

Harriet could find nothing to say to him She had fought him for five 
years, and found out nothmg but Ins strength , now, witJun half an hour, 
he had exposed all his weaknesses, one after die other And sne coaid not 
m honesty say Why didn’t you tell me before ^ ” because she knew 
perfecdy well what the answer ought to be Fortunately, he did not seem 
to expect any comment 

“ Great Scott * ” was his next remark, ** Look at the time I You’ve 

2x5 



let me maunder on, and weVe never said a word about your pro* 
blem ” 

** Fve been only too thankful to forget it for a bit ” 

“ I dare say you have,** he said, loobng thoughtfully at her Listen, 
Harriet, couldn’t we make to-day a holiday ^ YouVe had enough of this 
blasted business Come and be bothered with me for a change It’ll be a 
relief for you—hke gettmg a mce go of rheumatism in exchange for 
toothache Equally damnable, but different I’ve got to go to this lunch- 
party, but It needn’t take too long How about a punt at 3 o’clock from 
Magdalen Bridge ^ ” 

“ There’ll be an awful crowd on the river The Gherwell’s not what it 
was, especially on a Sunday More like Bank Holiday at Margate, with 
gramophones and bathing-dresses and everybody barging into everybody 
else ” 

“ Never mmd Let’s go and do our bit of barging along with the happy 
populace Unless you’d rather come in the car and fly with me to the 
world’s end But the roads will be worse than the river. And if we find a 
quiet spot, either I shall make a pest of myself or else we shall start on the 
infernal problem There’s safety in publicity ” 

Very well, Peter We’ll do exactly as you like ” 

“ Then we’U say Magdalen Bndge at three Trust me, I’m not shirking 
the problem If we can’t see our way through it together, we’ll find some- 
body who can There are no seas innavigable nor lands unhabitable ” 

He got up and held out a hand 

“ Peter, what a rock you are * The shadow of a great rock in a weary 
land My dear, what are you thinking about ^ One doesn’t shake hands 
at Oxford ” 

“ The elephant never forgets ” He kissed her fingers gently “ I have 
brought my formal cosmopolitan courtesy with me My God * talk of 
courtesy — I’m going to be late for lunch ” 

He snatched up cap and gown and was gone before she had time even 
to think of seeing him down to the Lodge 

But it’s just as well,” she thought, watching him run across the quad 
like an undergraduate, he hasn’t too much time as it is Bless the man, 
if he hasn’t taken my gown instead of his own ’ Oh, well, it doesn’t 
matter We’re much of a height and mine’s pretty wide on tlie shoulders, 
so it’s exactly the same thing ” 

And then it struck her as strai^e that it should be the same thing 

Hamet smiled to herself as she went to change for the river If Peter 
was keen on keeping up decayed traditions he would find plenty of 
opportunity by keeping to a pre-War standard of watermanship, ma nners 
and dress Especially dress A pair of grubby shoits or a faded regulation 
suit roUed neghgcntly about the waist was the modem version of Cher- 
well fashions for men , for women, a sun-bathing costume with (for the 
<116 ' 



tender-footed) a pair of gaily-coloured beach-sandals Harriet shook her 
head at the sunshine, which was now hot as well as bnght Even for the 
sake of startling Peter, she was not prepared to ofier a display of grilled 
back and mosqmto-bitten legs She would go seemlv and comfortable 
The Dean, meeting her under the beeches, gazed with eicaggerated 
surprise at her dazzling display of white linen and pipe-clay 

“ If this weie twenty years ago I should say you were going on the 
nver ” 

I am Hand in hand with a statelier past 
The Dean groaned gently “ I’m afraid you are makmg yourself con- 
spicuous That kind of thing is not done You are clothed, clean and cool 
On a Simday afternoon, too I am ashamed of you I hope, at least, the 
parcel under your arm contains the records of crooners ” 

“ Not even that,” said Harriet 

Actually, it contained her diary of the Shrewsbury scandal She had 
thought that the best thing would be to let Peter take it aw^ay and study it 
for himself Ihen he could decide what was best to be done about it 
She was punctual at the bndge, but found Peter there before her Ills 
obsolete politeness in this respect was emphasised by the presence of Miss 
Flaxman and another Shrewsbunan, who were sitting on the raft, 
apparently waiting for their escort, and looking rather hot and irntable 
It amused Hamet to let Wimsey take charge of her parcel, hand her 
ceremomously into the punt and arrange the cushions for her, and to 
know, by his iromcal eyes, that he perfectly well understood the reason 
of her unusual meekness 
“ Is It your pleasure to go up or down ^ ” 

“ Well, going up there’s more not but a better bottom , going down 
you’re all right as far as the fork, and then you choose between thick mud 
and the Corporation dump ” 

“ It appears to be altogether a choice of evils But you have only to 
command My ear is open like a greedy shark to catch the tumngs of a 
voice divine ” 

Great heavens ’ Where did you find that ^ ” 

“ That, though you might not believe it, is the crashing conclusion of 
a sonnet by Keats True, it is a youthful effort , but there are some things 
that even youth does not excuse ” 

“ Let us go down-stream I need solitude to recover from the shock ” 
He turned the punt out into the stream and shot the bridge accurately 
Then 

“Admirable woman • You have allowed me to spread the tail of 
vanity before that pair of deserted Ariadnes Would you now prefer to be 
independent and take the pole ^ I admit it is better fun to punt than to 
be pimted, and that a desire to have all the fun is nme-tentlis of the law 
of chivalry ” 

“ Is it possible that you have a just and generous mind ^ I will not be 

317 



outdone m generosity I will sit like a perfect lady and watch you do the 
work It*s nice to see things well done ” 

“ If you say that, I shall get conceited and do something silly ” 

He was, m fact, a pretty punter to watch, easy in action and quite 
remarkably quick They picked their way at surprising speed down the 
crowded and tortuous stream until, in the narrow reach above the ferry, 
they were checked by another punt, which was clumsily revolving in 
imd-stream and cramming a couple of canoes rather dangerously against 
the bank 

** Before you come on tins water,” cried Wimsey, thrusting the 
offenders off with his heel and staring offensively at the youth in charge 
(a stnngy young man, naked to the waist and shnmp-pink with the sun) 
** you shoiild learn the rule of the river Those canoes have the right of 
way And if you can*t handle a pole better than that, I recommend you 
to retire up the back-water and stay there till you know what God gave 
you feet for ” 

Whereat a middle-aged man, whose punt was moored a little way 
farther on, turned his head sharply and cried m ringing tones 
“ Good lord * Wimsey of Balliol * ” 

“ Well, well, well,” said his lordship, abandoning the pmk vouth, and 
rangmg up alongside the punt Peake of Brasenose, by all that’s holy 
What brmgs you here ^ ” 

“ Dash It,” said Mr, Peake, “ I live here What biingsj;ott here is more 
to the point You haven’t met my wife — Lord Peter Wimsey, my dear — 
the cncket blue, you know The rest is my family ” 

He waved his hand vaguely over a collection of assorted offspring 
“ Oh, I thought Fd look the old place up,” said Peter, when the 
introductions were completed all round “ I’ve got a nephew here and 
all that What are you doing ^ Tutor ^ Fellow ^ Lecturer ? ” 

“ Oh, I coach people A dog’s life, a dog’s life Dear me ^ A lot of water 
has flowed under Folly Bndge since we last met But I’d have known 
your voice anywhere The moment I heard those arrogant, off-hand, 
go-to-blazes tones I said, ‘ Wimsey of Balliol ’ Wasn’t I right ^ ” 

Wimsey shipped the pole and sat down 

** Have pity, old son, have pity ’ Let the dead bury their dead ” 

“ You know,” said Mr Peake to the world at large, “ when we were 
up together— shocking long time ago that is — never mind * If anyone got 
landed with a country cousin or an American visitor who asked, as these 
people will, ‘ What is this thing called the Oxford manner ^ ’ we used to 
take ’em round and show ’em Wimsey of Balliol He fitted in very handily 
between St John’s Gardens and the Martyrs’ Memorial ” 

But suppose he wasn’t there, or wouldn’t perform ^ ” 

** That catastrophe never occurred One never failed to find Wimsey 
of Balhol planted in the centre of the quad and laying down the law 
with exquisite ifisolence to somebody ” 

2iB 



Wimsey put his head between his hands 

‘ We were accustomed to lay bets,” went on Mr Peake, %vho seemed 
to have pieser\ed an undergraduate taste in humour, owing, no doubt, 
to continuous contact with Fust- Year mentality, * upon what they 
would say about him afterwards The Amencans mostly said, ‘ My, but 
isn’t he just the perfect English aristocrat * ’ but some of them said, * Does 
he need that glass m his eye or is it just part of the costoom ^ ” 

Harriet laughed, thinking of Miss Schuster-Siatt 

“ My dear ” sa^d Mrs Peake, who seemed to ha\e a kindly nature 

“ The country cousins,” said Mr Peake remorselessly, “ mvanably 
became speechless and had to be revi-ved with coffee and ices at BuoFs ” 
“ Don’t mind me,” said Peter, whose face was invisible, except for the 
tip of a cnmson ear 

But you’re weanng very well, Wimsey,” pursued Mr Peake, bene" 
volentiy “ Kept your waist-hne StJl good for a sprmt between the 
wickets ^ Can’t say I’m much use now, except for tne Parents* Match, eh, 
Jim ^ That’s what marriage does for a man — makes him fat and lazy 
But haven’t changed Not an atom Not a hair Absolutely unmis 
takable And you’re quite nght about these louts on the river I’m sick 
and tired of being barged into and getting their beastly punts over my 
bows They don’t even know enough to apologise Thmk it’s dashed 
funny Stupid oafs And gramophones bawling in your ears And look at 
’em ^ Just look at ’em ’ Enough to make you sick Like the monkey-house 
at the Zoo * ” 

** Noble and nude and antique ^ ” suggested Harriet 
“ I don’t mean that I mean the pole-climbmg Watch that girl — hand 
over hand, up she goes ’ And turning roimd to shove as if she was trying 
to clear a dram She’ll be in if she isn’t careful ” 

“ She’s dressed for it,” said Wimsey 
I’ll tell you what,” said Mr Peake, confidentially ” That’s the real 
reason for the costume They expeci to fail m It’s ail nght to come out 
with those beautiful creases down your flannels, but if you do go in it 
makes it all the funnier ” 

“ How true tnat is Well, we’re blocking the nver. We’d better be 
getting on I’ll look you up one day, if Mrs Peake will allow me So 
long ” 

The punts parted company 

“ Dear me,” said Peter, when they were out of earshot , " it’s pleasant 
to meet old fnends And very salutary ” 

“ Yes , but don’t you find it depressing when they go on making the 
same joke they were making about a hundred years ago ^ ” 

Devilish depressing It’s the one great drawback to living m this 
place It keeps you young Too young ’ 

“ It’s rather pathetic, isn’t it ? ” 

The nver was wwkr here, and by way of answer he bent his knees to 



the stroke, making the punt curtsey and the water run chuckling under 
the bows 

“ Would you have your youth back if you could, Harriet ^ ” 

Not for the world ” 

** Nor I Not for anything you could give me Perhaps that’s an 
exaggeration For one tlung you could give me I might want twenty years 
of my life pack But not the same twenty years And if I went back to my 
twenties, I shouldn’t be wanting the same tiung ” 

“ What makes you so sure of that ^ ” said Harriet, suddenly reminded 
of Mr Pomfret and the pro-Proctor 
** The vivid recollection of my own follies , . Harriet * Are you 
going to tell me that all young men in their twenties are not fools ^ ” He 
stood, trading the pole, and lookmg down at her , his raised eyebrows 
lent his face a touch of caricature 

“ Well, well, well I hope it is not Saint-George, by the way 
That would be a most unfortunate domestic comphcation ” 

** No, not Samt-George ” 

I thought not , his follies are less ingenuous But somebody Well, I 
refuse to be alarm^, since you have sent him about his business ” 

“ I like the rapidity of your deductions ” 

” You are incurably honest If you had done anything drastic you 
would have told me so m your letter You would have said, * Dear 
Peter, I have a case to submit to you , but before doing so I think it only 
right to inform you that I am engaged to Mr Jones of Jesus ’ Should you 
not ^ ” 

** Probably Should you have investigated the case all the same ^ ** 

** Why not ^ A case is a case What is the bottom like in the Old 
River ^ ” 

“ Foul You’re pulled back two strokes for every stroke you make ” 

** Then we will stick to the New Gut Well, Mr. Jones of Jesus has my 
sincere sympathy. I hope his troubles will not affect his class ” 

“ He is only in his Second year ” 

Then he has time to get over it I should like to meet him He is 
probably the best fnend I have in the world ” 

Harriet said nothing Peter’s mtelligence could always make nngs 
round her own more slowly-movmg wits It was quite true that the 
spontaneous affections of Reggie Pomfret had, somehow, made it easier 
to believe that Peter’s own feehngs might be something more than an 
artist’s tenderness for Jus own achievement But it was mdecent of Peter 
to reach that conclusion so rapidly She resented the way in which he 
walked in and out of her mind ais if it was his own fiat. 

“ Good God ^ ” said Peter, suddenly. He peered with an air of alarm 
into the dark green water A string of oily bubbles floated slowly to the 
surface, showmg where the pole had struck a patch of mud , and at the 
same moment their nostrils were assaulted by a loathsome stench of decay 

9StO 



“ What’s the matter ^ ” 

** Fve struck something horrible Can’t you smell it ^ It’s scandalous 
the way corpses pursue me about Honestly, Harriet ” 

“ My dear idiot, it’s only the Corporation garoage dump ” 

His eye followed her pointing hand to the farther bank, where a cloud 
of flies circled about a hornd mound of putiefact*on 

“ Well, of all the • What the devil do they mean by doing a tmng 

like that ^ ” He passed a wet hand across his forehead For a moment 
I really thought I had run across Mr Jones of Jesus I was beginn r g to 
be sorry I had spoken so light-heartedly about the poor cnap Here ‘ 
Let’s get out of this * ” 

He drove the punt vigorously fonvard 
“ The Isis for me There is no romance left on this nver ” 


CHAPTER XV 

Do but consider what an excellent thing sleep is it is so in- 
estimable a jewel that, if a tyrant would give his crown for an 
hour’s slumber, it cannot be bought of so beautiful a shape *s 
it, that though a man he with an Empress, his heart cannot beat 
quite till he leaves her embracements to be at rest \.nth the 
other yea, so greatly indebted are we to this kinsman of death,

“ You Will find the tea-basket,” said Wimsey, “ behind you m “"he bows 
They had put m under the dappled shade of an overhanging willow a 
little down the left bank of the Isis Here there was less crowd, and ’•vhat 
there was could pass at a distance Here, if anywhere, the> might hope 
for comparative peace It was, therefore, with moie than ordinary irri- 
tation that Harriet, with the thermos yet in her hand, observed a 
heavily-laden punt approaching 


221 



" Miss Schuster-Siatt and her part>' Oh, God * and she says she knows 
you ” 

The poles were firmly dnven m at either end of the boat , escape was 
impossible Ineluctably the American contingent advanced upon them 
They were alongside Miss Schustei-Slatt was crying out excitedly It 
was Harriet’s turn to blush for her friends With incredible coyness Miss 
Schuster-Siatt apologised foi her intrusion, effected introductions, was 
sure they were ternbly in the way, reminded Lord Peter of their former 
encounter, recogmsed that he was far too pleasantly occupied to wish to 
be bothered with her, poured out a flood of alarming enthusiasm about 
the Propagation of the Fit, again drew stndent attention to her own 
tactlessness, informed Lord Peter that Harriet w^as a lovely person and 
just too sympathetic, and favoured each of them with an advance copy 
of her new questionnaire Wimsey listened and replied with impel turb- 
able urbanity, while Harnet, wishing that the Isis would flood its banks 
and drown them all, envied his self-command When at length Miss 
Schuster-Slatt removed herself and her party, the treacherous water 
wafted back her shrill voice from afar 
“ Well, girls ^ Didn’t I tell you he was just the perfect English 
aristocrat ^ ” 

At which point the much-tried Wimsey lay down among the tea-cups 
and became hystencal 

** Peter,” said Harnet, when he had fiilished crowing like a cock, 
“ your unconquerable sweetness of disposition is very shaming I lose my 
temper with that harmless woman Have some more tea ” 

** I think,” said his lordship, mournfully, ” I had better stop being the 
perfect English anstocrat and become the great detective after all Fate 
seems to be turmng my one-day romance into a roaring farce If that is 
the dossier, let me have it We’ll see,” he added with a faint chuckle, 
” what bnd of a detective you make when you’re left to yourself ” 

Harriet handed him the loose-leaf book and an envelope contammg the 
vanous anonymous documents, all endorsed, where possible, with the 
date and manner of publication He examined the documents first, 
separately and carefully, without manifesting surprise, disgust, or, 
indeed, any emotion beyond meditative interest He then put them ajl 
back m the envelope, filled and lit a pipe, curled himself up among the 
cushions and devoted his attention to her manuscript He read slowly, 
turmng back every now and again to verify a date or a detail At the end 
of the first few pages he looked up to remark 
“ I’ll say one thing for the wntmg of detective fiction you know how 
to put your story together , how to ariange the evidence ” 

Thank you,” said Harriet dnly , “ praise from Sir Hubert is praise 
indeed ” 

He read on 

His next observation was 
322 



“ I see you have eliminated ail the servants in the Scouts* Wmg on the 
strength of one locked door 

“ I’m not so simple-minded as that When you come to the Chapel 
episode, you’ll find that it eliminates them all, for anothei reason ” 

“ I beg your pardon , I was committing the fatal error of theorising 
ahead of my data ” 

Accepting rebuke, he relapsed into silence, while she studied his half- 
averted face Considered generally, as a fagade, it was by this time 
tolerably familiar to her, but now she saw details, magnified aA» it were 
by some glass in her own mind The flat settmg and fine scroll-work of 
the ear, and the height of the skull above it The glitter of close-cropped 
hair where the neck-muscles lifted to meet the head A nunute sickle- 
shaped scar on the left temple The famt laaghter-Imes at the corner of 
the eye and the droop of the lid at its outer end The gleam of golden 
down on the cheek-bone The wide spnng of the nostril An almost 
imperceptible beading of sweat on the upper hp and a tiny muscle that 
twitched the sensitive corner of the mouth The slight sun-reddenmg of 
the fair skin and its sudden whiteness below the base of the throat The 
little hollow above the points of the collar-bone 
He looked up , and she was instantly scarlet, as though she had been 
dipped in boiling water Through the confusion of her darkened eyes 
and drumming ears some enormous bulk seemed to stoop over her Then 
the mist cleared His eyes were nveted upon the manusenpt again, but 
he breathed as though he had been runmng 
So, thought Harriet, it has happened But it happened long ago The 
only new thing that has happened is that now I have got to admit it to 
myself I have known it for some time But does he know it ^ He has 
very little excuse, after this, for not knowing it Apparently he refuses 
to see It, and that may be new If so, it ought to be easier to do what 
I meant to do 

She stared out resolutely across the dimpling water But she was con- 
scious of his every movement, of everv page he turned, of every breath he 
drew She seemed to be separately conscious of e\ery bone m his body 
At length he spoke, and she wondered how she could ever have mistaken 
another man’s voice for his 
“ Well, Harriet, it’s not a pretty problem ” 

It’s not And it simply mustn’t go on, Peter We can’t have any more 
people frightened into the river Publicity or no pubhcity, it’s got to be 
stopped Otherwise, even if nobody else gets hurt, we shall all go mad 
“That’s the devil of it ” 

“ Tell me what we are to do, Peter ” 

She had once again lost all consciousness of him except as the familiar 
intelligence that lived and moved so cunously behind an oddly amusing 
set of features 

“ Well — there arc two possibihties. You can plant spies all over the 

22 $ 



place and wait to pounce on this person when the next outbreak 
occurs ” 

“ But you don’t know what a difficult place it is to police And it’s 
ghastly waiting for the outbreak And suppose we don’t catch her and 
something horrible happens ” 

“ I agree The other, and I think the better, way is to do what we can 
to frighten tins lunatic into keeping quiet while we dig out the motive 
behind tlie nhole thing I’m sure it’s not mere blind malignity , there’s 
a method in it ” 

** Isn’t the motive only too painfully obvious ^ ” 

He stared pensively at her, and then said 

** You remind me of a charming old tutor, now dead, whose particular 
subject of research was the lelations of the Papacy to the Church m 
England between certain dates which I do not precisely recall At one 
time, a special subject on these lines was set for the History School, and 
undergraduates taking that subject were naturally sent to the old boy 
for coaching and did very well But it was noticed that no man from his 
own college ever entered for that particular special — the reason being 
that the tutor’s honesty was such that he would earnestly dissuade his 
pupils from taking his own subject for fear lest his encouragement might 
influence their decision 

“ What a charming old gentleman * I’m flattered by the comparison, 
but I don’t see the point ” 

“ Don’t you ^ Isn’t it a fact that, having more or less made up your 
mmd to a spot of celibacy you are eagerly peoplmg the cloister with 
bogies ^ If you want to do without personal relationships, then do with- 
out them Don’t stampede yourself into them by imagimng that you’ve 
got to have them or qualify for a Freudian case-book ” 

“ We’re not talkmg about me and my feehngs We’re talking about 
this beastly case in College ” 

“ But you can’t keep your fcelmgs out of the case It’s no use saymg 
vaguely that sex is at the bottom of all these phenomena — that’s about 
as helpful as saying that human nature is at the bottom of them Sex 
isn’t a separate thing functionmg away all by itself It’s usually found 
attached to a person of some sort ” 

That’s rather obvious ” 

“ Well, let’s have a look at the obvious The biggcsi crime of these 
blasted psychologists is to have obscured the obvious They’re like a man 
packing for the week-end and turmng everything out of Ins drawers and 
cupboards till he can’t find his pyjamas and toothbrush Take a few 
obvious pomts to start with You and Miss de Vine met at Shrewsbury 
for the first time at the Gaudy, and the fint letter was put into your sleeve 
at that time , the people attacked are nearly all dons or scholars , a few 
days after your tea-party with young Pomfret, Jukes goes to prison , all 
the letters received by post come either on a Monday or a Thursday , 
3S4 



all the communications are in English except the Harpy quotation , the 
dress found on the dummy was never seen m College do all those facts 
taken together suggest nothing to you beyond a general notion of sex 
repression ^ 

“ They suggest a lot of things separately, but I can’t make anything of 
them taken together ” 

“ You are usually better than that at a synthesis I vvisn you could 
clear this personal preoccupation out of your mind My dear, what are 
you afraid of ^ The two great dangers of the celibate life are a forced 
choice and a vacant mind Energies bombmatmg in a vacuum breed 
chimaeras But you are in no danger If you want to set up your ever- 
lasting rest, you are far more likely to find it in the life of the mind than 
the life of the heart ” 

“ Ton say that ^ 

“ I say that It is your needs we arc considering, vou know , not any- 
body else’s That is my opinion as an honest scholar, viewing the 
question academically and on its merits ” 

She had the old sensation of being outwitted She grasped again at the 
mam theme of the discussion 

“ Then you think we can sol\e the problem by straight detection, 
without calling m a mental specialist ? ” 

I think It can be solved by a little straight and unprejudiced 
reasomng ” 

“ Peter I seem to be behaving very stupidly But the reason wrhy I 
want to — to get clear of people and feelings and go back to the intellec- 
tual side is £hat that is the only side of life I haven’t betiayed and made 
a mess of ” 

“ I know that,” he said, more gently “ And it’s upsetting to think that 
it may betray you m its turn But why should you think that ^ Even if 
much learmng makes one person mad it need not make everybody mad 
All these women are beginmng to look abnormal to you because you 
don’t know which one to suspect, but actually even you don’t suspect 
more than one ” 

“ No , but I’m beginning to feel that almost any one of them might be 
capable of it ” 

“ That, I fancy, is where >our fears are distorting your judgment I* 
every frustrate person is heading straight for the asylum I know at least 
one danger to Society who ought to be shut up ” 

” Damn you, Peter Will you keep to the point * ” 

“ Meanmg what steps ought w^e to take ^ Will vou give me to-mght 
to think it over ^ If you wall trust me to deal wath it, I fancy I see one or 
two lines that might be followed up with profit ” 

I would rather trust you than anybody ” 

“Thank you, Harriet Shall we now resume our mternipted hoLday ^ 
Oh, my lost youth. Here are the ducks commg up for the remams 

GJ« —6 225 



of our sandwiches Twenty-three years ago I fed these identical ducks 
with these identical sandwiches 

Ten years ago^ I too fed them to bursting-point ” 

** And ten and twenty years hence the same ducks and the same under- 
graduates will share the same ritual feast, and the ducks will bite the 
undergraduates* fingers as they have just batten mine How fleeting are 
all human passions compared with the massive continuity of ducks 
Be off, cullies, that’s the lot 

He tossed the last crumbs of bread into the water, rolled over among the 
cushions and lay watching the iipples with half-shut eyes A punt 

went past, full of silent, sim-stupefied people, with a plop and a tinkle 
alternately as the pole entered and left the water , then a nojisy party 
with a gramophone bawling “ Love in Bloom ” , then a young man in 
spectacles, by himself m a canoe, and paddling as though for dear life , 
then another punt, paddled at a funeral pace by a whispenng man and 
girl , then a hot and energetic party of girls in an outrigger , then 
another canoe, driven swiftly by two Canadian undergraduates kneeling 
to their work , then a very small canoe, punted dangerously by a giggling 
girl in a bathing-diess, with a jeering young man crouched in the bows, 
costumed, and obviously prepared, for the inevitable plunge , then a 
very sedate and fully-clothed party m a punt — ^mixed undergraduates 
being polite to a female don , then a bunch of both sexes and all ages m 
an inngger with another gramophone whining “ Love m Bloom ” — the 
Town at play , then a succession of shrill cries which announced the 
arrival of a hilarious party teaching a novice to punt , then^n ludicrous 
contrast, a very stout man in a blue suit and linen hat, smemnly pro- 
pelling himself all alone in a two-pair tub, and a slim, singjeted youth 
shooting contemptuously past him m a pair-oar skiff , then three punts 
side by side, in which everybody seemed to be asleep except those 
actually responsible for pole and paddle One of these passed within a 
paddle’s length of Harriet a tousle-headed, rather paimchy young man 
lay with his knees cocked up, his mouth slightly open and his fkce flushed 
with the heat , a girl sprawled against his shoulder, while the man 
opposite, his hat over his face and his hands clasped over his chest with 
the thumbs beneath his braces, had also given up all interest in the outer 
world The fouith passenger, a woman, was eating chocolates The 
punter had a crumpled cotton frock and bare legs, much bitten Harriet 
was reminded of a third-class railway compartment m an excursion tram 
on a hot day , it was fatal to sleep m public , and how tempting to throw 
something at the paunchy youth At that moment, the chocolate-eater 
screwed her remaining loUipops tightly in the bag and did throw it at the 
paunchy youth It caught him in the midnff, and he woke with a loud 
snort Harnet took a cigarette from her case and turned to ask her 
companion for a match He was asleep 

It was a neat and noiseless kmd of sleep , the posture loaight be dc- 
22^6 



scribed the half-hedgehog, and offered neither month nor stomach as a 
target for missiles But asleep he undoubtedly was And here was Miss 
Harriet Vane, gone suddenly sympathetic, afraid to move for fear of 
waking him and savagely resentmg the approach of a boatload of idiots 
wnose gramophone was plaving (for a change) “ Love Bbom 

“ How wonderful,’^ sa^^ the poet, “ is Death, Death arc n^s brothe- 
Sieep ^ ** And, having asked whether lanthe will wake aga r and oeing 
assured that she will, he proceeds to weave many beaut^j^ thoughts 
about lanthe’s sleep From this we may fairly deduce that he (liRe Henry 
who kneeled m silence by her couch) felt tenderly towaros lantne For 
another person’s sleep is the acid test of our own sentiments Umess we 
are savages, we react kindly to death, whether of friend or enemv It docs 
not exasperate us , it does not tempt us to throw things at it , we do not 
find It funny Death is the ultimate w^eakness, and we dare not insult it 
But sleep is only an illusion of weakness and, unless it aopea’s to our 
protective instincts, is likely to arouse m us a nasty, bullvnng spirit From 
a height of conscious superiority we look down on the sleeper, thus 
exposing himself in all his frailty, and indulge in derisive commert upon 
hxs appearance, his manners and (if the occasion is a public one) the 
absurdity of the position in which he has placed his compamon, if ne has 
one, and particularly if we are that companion 

Harriet, thus cozened into playing Phoebe to the sleeping Enavmion, 
had plenty of opportunity to examine herself After careful consideration 
she decided that what she most needed was a box of matches Peter had 
used matches to light his pipe where were they ^ He had gone to sleep 
on the whole outfit, confound him * But his blazer was beside Him on the 
cushions , had anybody ever known a man to carry only one box of 
matches in his pockets ^ 

To take possession of the blazer was ticklish work, for the punt rocked 
at every movement and she had to lift the garment over his knees , bu^ 
his sleep was the deep sleep of physical fatigue, and she crav led back in 
tnumph without having wakened him With a cunous sense of gUilt she 
ransacked his pockets, finding three boxes of matches, a book ard a 
corkscrew With tobacco and literature one could face out arv situation, 
provided, of course, that the book was not wntten in an unknowm tongue 
The spine was untitled, and as she turned back the worn calf co^ er the 
first thang she saw was the engraved book-plate with its achievement of 
arms the three silver mice on a field sable and the “ domestick Catt ” 
couched menacingly on the helmet-wreath T%vo armed Saracens sup- 
ported the shield, beneath which ran the mocking and arrogant motto 
“ As my Whimsy takes me ” She turned on to the title-page Riligio 
Medut Well * . . Well ^ Was that so very unexpected ^ 

Why did he travel about with that ^ Did he fill in the spare moments of 
detection and diplomacy with musing upon the “ strange ann mystical ” 
transmigrations of silkworms and the “ legerdemain of changelings ^ 

227 



or with considering how “ we vainly accuse the fury of guns and the new 
inventions of death ” ’ Certainly there is no happiness within this 
circle of flesh , nor is it m the opticks of these eyes to behold felicity 
The first day of our jubilee is death She had no wish to suppose that he 
could find any personal application for that , she would rather have him 
secure and happy in order that she might resent his happy security She 
flicked the pages over hurnediy “ When I am fiom him, I am dead till 
I be with him United souls are not satisfied with embraces, but desire 
to be truly each other , which being impossible, these desires are infimte, 
and must proceed without a possibility of satisfaction That was a most 
uncomfortable passage, whichever way you looked at it She turned 
back to the first page and began to read steadily, with critical attenUon 
to grammar and style, so as to occupy the upper current of her mind 
wiAout prying too closely into what might be going on beneath the 
surface 

The sun moved down the sky and the shadows lengthened upon the 
water There were fewer craft on the nver now , the tca-parties were 
hurrying home to dinner and the supper-parties had not yet put out 
Endymion had the air of being settled for the mght , it was really time to 
harden her heart and pull up the poles She put off decision from moment 
to moment, till a loud shnek and a bump at her end of the punt came to 
spare her the trouble The incompetent novice had returned with her 
crew and, having left her pole in the middle of the river, had let her 
craft drift across their stem Harnct pushed tlie mtrudcrs off with more 
vigour than sympathy and turned to find her host sitting up and gnnmng 
rather sheepishly 

“ Havel been asleep^” 

“ Getting on for two hours,” said Harriet, with a pleased chuckle 

“ Good lord, what disgusting behaviour ’ I am frightfully sorry Why 
didn’t you give me a shout ^ What time is it ^ My poor girl, you’ll get no 
dinner to-mght if we don’t hurry up Look here, I do apologise most 
abjectly ” 

“ It doesn't matter a bit You were awfully tired ” 

“ That’s no excuse ” He was on his feet now, extncating the punt-poles 
from the mud “ We might make it by double-pimtmg — ^if you’ll forgive 
the infernal check of asking you to work to make up for my soul-destroy- 
mg sloth ” 

“ I’d love to pimt But, Peter * ” She suddenly liked hiyn enormously 
” What’s the hurry ? I mean, is the Master expecting you, or any- 
thing ^ ” 

** No , I’ve removed myself to the Mitre I can’t use the Master’s 
Lodgings as a hotel , besides, they’ve got people coming m ” 

** Then couldn’t we get something to eat somewhere along the nver 
and make a day of it ^ I mean, if you feel like it Or must you have a 
proper dmner ^ ” 



“ My dear, I would gladly eat husks ror having beha\ed like a nog 
Or thistles Preferably thistles You are a most forgi\mg woman ’’ 

** Well, give me the pole I’ll stay up in the bows and you can oo the 
steering ” 

And watch you bring the pole up in th’-ee ” 

** I promise to do that ’’ 

She was conscious, nevertheless, of Wmisey of Balliors cnticai eye upon 
her handling of the heavy pole For either you look graceful or you look 
ghastly , there is no middle way in puntmg They set the r course tov/ard«^ 
Iffley* 


“ On the whole,’’ said Harnet, as they took boat again some ii^tte time 
later, “ thistles would have been preferable ” 

“ That kind of food is proMded for very young people whose minds 
are elsewhere Men of passions but no parts I am glad to iia\ e dined on 
apricot flan and synthetic lemonade , it enlarges one s experience ShaU 
I, you or we pole ^ Or shall we abandon aloofness supe’“iont> and 
paddle m beauty side by side ^ ” His eyes mocked her ‘ I am tame , 
pronounce ” 

“ Whichevei you prefer ” 

He handed her gravely to the stem seat and coiled down beside 

her 

** What the devil am I sitting on ^ ” 

“ Sir Thomas Browne, I expect I’m afraid I nded y c c^r pockets 
Smce I was such a bad compamon, I’m glad I provided yo.* with a 
good substitute ” 

“ Is he a constant compamon of yours ^ ” 

“ My tastes are fairly catholic It might easily have been Kat Lung or 

Alice tn Wonderland or Macchiavelli ” 

“ Or Boccaccio or the Bible ^ ” 

“ Just as likely as not Or Apuleius ” 

“ Or John Donne 

He was silent for a moment, and then said in a changed vo ce 
“ Was that a bow drawn at a venture ^ ” 

“A good shot^” 

“ Whang m the gold Between the joints ''of the harness If 

you would paddle a httle on your side it would make it hardier to 
steer ” 

“ Sorry Do you find it easy to get drunk on v/o^ds ” 

“ So easy that to tell you the truth, I am seldom perfectly sober 
Which accoimts for my talking so much ” 

And yet, if anybody had asked me, I should have said vou had a 
passion for balance and order—no beauty without measure ” 

** One may have a passion for the imactamahle ” 


229 



But you do attain it At least, you appear to attain ” 

“ The perfect Augustan ^ No , Fm afraid it’s at most a balance of 
opposing forces The river’s filling up again ” 

“ Lots of people come out after supper ” 

“ Yes — ^well, bless their hearts, why shouldn’t they ^ You’re not feeling 
cold ? ” 

Not the least bit ” 

That was the second time within five minutes that he had warned her 
off his pnvate ground His mood had changed since the early hours of 
the afternoon and all his defences were up once more She could not 
again disregard the “ No Thoroughfare ” sign , so she left it to him to 
start a fresh subject 

He did so, courteously enough, by asking how the new novel was 
getting on 

It’s gone sticky ” 

‘‘ What’s happened to it ^ ” 

This involved a full rehearsal of the plot of Death Hwixt Wind and Water 
It was a complicated story, and the punt had covered a good deal of 
water before she reached the solution 
“ There’s nothing fundamentally wrong with that,” said he , and 
proceeded to offer a few suggestions about detail 
“ How intelligent you are, Peter You’re quite right Of course that 
would be much the best way to get over the clock difficulty But why 
does the whole story sound so dead and alive ^ ” 

“ If you ask me,” said Wxmsey, ^ it’s Wilfrid, I know he mames the 
girl — ^but must he be such a mutt ^ Why does he go and pocket the 
evidence and tell all those unnecessary lies ^ ” 

“ Because he thinks the girl’s done it ” 

“ Yes — but why should he ? He’s dotingly in love with her — ^he thinks 
she’s absolutely the cat’s pyjamas — and yet, merely because he finds her 
handkerchief in the bedroom he is instantly convinced, on evidence that 
wouldn’t hang a dog, that she not only is Winchester’s mistress but has 
also murdered him in a pecuharly diabohcal way That may be one way 
of love, but ” 

“ But, you would like to point out, it isn’t yours — and in fact, it wasn’t 
yours ” 

There it was again— the old resentment, and the impulse to hit bark 
savagely for the pleasure of seeing him wmee 
“ No,” he said, ” I was considenng the question impersonally ” 

“ Academically, in fact ” 

“ Yes — please From a purely constructional point of view, I 

don’t feel that Wilfrid’s behaviour is sufficiently accounted for.” 

” Well,” said Harriet, recovenng her poise, “ academically speaking, 
I admit that Wilfnd is the world’s worst goop But if he doesn’t conceal 
the handkerchief, where’s my plot ? ” 

m 



** Couldn’t you make WilfHd one those morbidly conscientious 
people, who have been brought up to think that anything pleasant must 
be wrong — so that, if he wants to believe the girl an angel of light she is, 
for that very reason, ail the more likely to be guilty. Give him a 
puritanical father and a hell-fire religion.” 

“ Peter, that’s an idea,” 

“ He has, you see, a gloomy conviction that love is sinful in itself, and 
that he can only purge himself by taking the young woman’s sins upon 
him and wallowing in vicarious suffering. . . . He’d still be a goop, and 
a pathological goop, but he would be a bit more consistent.” 

“ Yes — he’d be interesting. But if I give Wilfrid all those violent and 
lifelike feelings, he’ll throw the whole book out of balance.” 

** You would have to abandon the jig-saw kind of story and write a 
book about human beings for a change.” 

“ I’m afraid to try that, Peter. It might go too near the bone.” 

“ It might be the wisest thing you could do.” 

“ Write it out and get rid of it ? ” 

“ Yes.” 

“ I’ll think about that. It would hurt like hell.” 

“ What would that matter, if it made a good book ? ” 

She was taken aback, not by what he said, but by his saying it. She had 
never imagined that he regarded her work very seriously, and she had 
certainly not expected him to take this ruthless attitude about it. The 
protective male ? He was being about as protective as a can-opener, 

“ You haven’t yet,” he went on, “ written the book you could write if 
you tried. Probably you couldn’t write it when you were too close to 
things. But you could do it now, if you had the — the ” 

‘’The guts?” 

“ Exactly.” 

“ I don’t think I could face it.” 

“ Yes, you could. And you’ll get no peace till you do. I’ve been run- 
ning away from myself for twenty years, and it doesn’t work. What’s the 
good of making mistakes if you don’t use them ? Have a shot. Start on 
Wnfrid.” 

“ Damn Wilfrid ! ... All right. I’ll try. I’ll knock the saw>-dust out 
of Wilfrid, anyhow.” 

He took his right hand from the paddle and held it out to her, 
deprecatingly. 

“ * Always laying down the law with exquisite insolence to somebody.’ 
I’m sorry.” 

She accepted the hand and the apology and they paddled on in amity. 
But it was true, she thought, that she had had to accept a good deal more 
than that. She was quite surprised by her own lack of resentment. 

They parted at the postern. 

” Good night, Harriet. I’ll bring back your man\iscript to-morrow. 

231 



Would some time m the afternoon suit you ^ I must lunch with young 
Gerald, I suppose, and play the heavy uncle ** 

“ Come round about six, then Good mght — ^and thank you very 
much ’’ 

“ I am m your debt ” 

He waited politely while she shut and locked the heavy guile against 
him 

“ And so-o-o ** (in saccharine accents), “ the co-onvent gates closed 
behind So-o-onia * ” 

He smote his forehead with a theatrical gesture and an anguished cry 
and reeled away almost into the arms of the Dean, who was coming up 
the road at her usual brisk trot 

“ Serve him right,” said Harriet, and fled up the path without waiting 
to see what happened 

As she got into bed she recalled the extempore prayer of a well-mean- 
ing but incoherent curate, heard once and never forgotten 

“ Lord, teach us to take our hearts and look them m the face, however 
difficult It may be ”

ROBERT HERRICK 

** Oh miss • ” 

“ We arc so sorry to disturb you, madam ” 

“ Good gracious, Came, what is it ^ ” 

When you have been lying awake for an hour or so wondering how to 
reconstruct a Wilfrid without inflicting savage mayhem upon your plot, 
and have just tumbled into an uneasy slumber haunted by the embalmed 
bodies of dukes, it is annoying to be jerked into consciousness again by 
two excited and partly hysterical maid-servants in dressing-gowns 

Oh, miss, the Dean said to come and tell you Annie and me have 
been so fnghtened We nearly caught it ” 

Caught what?” 

** Whatever it is, miss In the Science lecture-room, miss We saw it 
there It was awful ” 

Hamet sat up, dazed. 

** And it^s gone off, miss, rampaging something horrible, and nobody 

232 



knows what it mayn’t be up to, so we thought we ought to tell some- 
body ” 

“ For goodness’ sake, Game, do tell me Sit down, both of you, and 
begin from the beginmng ” 

“ But, miss, didn’t we ought to see what’s gone v^ith it ? Out through 
the dark-room window, that’s where it went, and it may be murdering 
people at this very minute And the room locked and the key inside — 
there might be a dead body lying there, all blood ” 

“ Don’t be ndiculous,” said Harriet But sue got out of bed, none the 
less, and began to hunt for her shppers “ If somebody’s playing another 
practical joke, we must try and stop it But don’t let’s have any nonsense 
about blood and bodies Where did it go to ^ ” 

“ We don’t know, miss ” 

Harriet looked at the stout and agitated Carrie, whose face was 
puckered and twitching and her eyes boitmg with imminent h>'stena 
She had never thought the present head scout any too dependable, and 
was inclined to put down her abundant energy to an excess of thyroid 
“ Where is the Dean, then ^ ” 

“ Waiting by the lecture-room door, miss She said to fetch you ” 

“ All right ” 

Harriet put her torch into her dressmg-govm pocket and hustled her 
visitors out 

** Now tell me quickly what’s the matter, and don’t make a noise ” 

** Well, miss, Annie comes to me and says ” 

“ When was this ^ ” 

“ About a quarter of an hour ago, miss, or it might be more or less ” 

** About that, madam ” 

“ I was m bed and asleep, never dreammg of nothing, and Anme says, 
‘Have you got the keys, Came ^ There’s something funny going on in the 

lecture-room ’ So I says to Anme ” 

“Just a mmute Let Anme tell her part first ” 

“ Well, madam, you know the Science lecture-room at the back of the 
New Quad, and how you can see it from our wing I woke up about 
half-past one and happened to look out of my window and I saw a light 
in the lecture-room So I thought, that’s funny, as late as this. And I saw 
a shadow on the curtain, like somebody moving about ” 

“ The curtains were drawn, then ^ ” 

“ Yes, madam, but they’re only buff casement-cloth, you know, so I 
could see the shadow as plam as plain So I watched a bit, and the 
shadow went away but the light stayed on and I thought it was funny 
So I went and woke Came and said to her to give me the keys so as I 
could go and look in case it was something that wasn’t qmte nght And 
she saw the hght, too And I said, ‘ Oh, Game, come with me , I don’t 
like to go alone ’ So Came came down with me ” 

“ Did you go through the Hall or across the yard ^ ” 

8* 233 



Across the yard, madam We thought it would be quicker Through 
the yard and the iron gate And we tned to look through the window, but 
it was tight shut and the curtains pulled close 

They were out of Tudor Building now , its corridors as they passed 
through had seemed quiet enough Nor did there seem to be any disturb- 
ance in the Old Quad The Library Wing was dark, except for a lamp 
burning in Miss de Vine’s window and the dim illumination of the 
passage lights 

“ When we came to the lecture-room door, it was locked and the key 
in it, because I stooped down to look through the hole, but I couldn’t see 
anything And then I saw that the curtain wasn’t quite drawn across the 
door — ^it has glass panels, you know, madam So I looked through the 
crack and saw something all m black, madam And I said, ‘ Oh, there it 
IS * ’ And Carrie said, * Let me see,’ and she gave me a bit of a push and 
my elbow bumped against the door and that must have frightened it, 
because the light went out ” 

“ Yes, miss,” said Carrie, eagerly “ And I said, ‘ There now » ’ and 
then there was a most awful crash inside — dreadful, it was, and something 
bumping, and I calls out, * Oh, it’s coming out after us * ’ ” 

** And I said to Game, ‘ Run and fetch the Dean * We’ve got it m 
here ’ So Carrie went for the Dean and I heard whoever it was moving 
about a bit, and then I didn’t hear anything more ” 

** And the Dean came along and we waned a bit, and I said * Ooh * 
do you think it’s lying in there with its throat cut * and the Dean said, 
* There, now * How silly we’ve been It’ll have gone out through the 
window ’ And I says, ‘ But all them windows are barred,’ I says And 
the Dean says, ‘ The dark-room window, that’s where it’s gone ’ The 
dark-room door was locked too, so we run round outside and sure 
enough, there’s the window wide open So the Dean says, ‘ Fetch Miss 
Vane,’ So we comes for you, miss ” 

By this time they had reached the east angle of the New Qpad, where 
Miss Martin stood waiting 

“ Our friend’s vanished. I’m afraid,” said the Dean “ We ought to 
have been quick enough to think of that wmdow I’ve been round this 
quad, but I can’t find anything wrong there Let’s hope the creature’s 
gone back to bed ” 

Hamet examined the door It was certainly locked from the inside, 
and the curtain over the glass panel did not fit quite closely But every- 
thing within was dark and silent 

“ What does Sherlock Holmes do now ^ ” inquired the Dean 
I think we go m,” said Harnet I suppose you haven’t such a thing 
as a pair of long-nosed pliers ^ No Weil, it’s probably just as good to 
break the glass.” 

** Don’t cut yourself” 

How many times, thought Hamet, had her detective, Robert Temple- 
234 



ton, broken through doors to discover the dead body of the murdered 
financier ^ With a ludicrous feeling that she was acting a part, she laid 
a fold of her dressing-gown across the panel and delivered a sharp blow 
upon it with her closed fist Rather to her astonishment, the panel broke 
inwards exactly as it should have done, to the accompaniment of a 
modest tinkle of glass Now — a scarf or handkerchief wTapped round to 
protect the hand and wrist, and prevent leaving extra finger-pnnts on 
key and handle The Dean obligingly fetched this needful accessory, and 
the door was opened 

Harriet’s first glance by torch-light was for the switch It stood in the 
** OfT” position, and she struck it down with the handle of the torch 
The room stood revealed 

It was a rather bare, uncomfortable place, furmshed with a couple of 
long tables, a quantity of hard chairs and a blackboard It was called tlie 
Science lecture-room partly because Miss Edwards occasionally used it 
for coachings that needed little in the way of appaiatus, but chiefly 
because some dead-and-damned benefactor had left to the College a 
sum of money, together with a quantity of scientific books, anatomical 
casts, portraits of deceased scientists and glass cases filled w'lth geological 
specimens , saddling this already sufficiently embarrassing bequest with 
the condition that all the bric-a-brac should be housed in one room 
together Otherwise there was nothing that particularly fitted the room 
for scientific study, except that it commumcated on one side with a closet 
contaimng a sink The closet was occasionally used by photographic 
enthusiasts as a dark-room, and was so called 

The cause of the crash and bumping heard by the tw^o scouts was 
plain enough as soon as the light was turned on The blackboard had 
been flung to the ground and a few chairs displaced, as though somebody, 
hurriedly making her way from the room in the dark, had become en- 
tangled among the furmture The most mteresting thing about the room 
was the collection of things that lay on one of the tables There was a 
spread sheet of newspaper, on which stood a paste-pot with a brush in 
It, part of a cheap scribbling block and the lid of a cardboard box, filled 
with cut-out letters Also, laid out upon the table were several messages, 
couched in the Poison-Pen’s now familiar style, and pasted together in 
the usual way , while a half-finished work m the same style of art had 
fluttered to the floor, showing that the Pen had been interrupted in the 
middle of her work 

“ So here’s where she does it * cned the Dean 

** Yes,” said Harriet “ I wonder why It seems unnecessarily pubhc 
Why not her own room ^ I say, Dean — don’t pick that up, if you 
don’t mind Better leave everything as it is ” 

The door m the dark-room was open Harnet went in and examined 
the sink, and the open window above it Marks in the dust showed 
clearly where sometlnng had scrambled over the sill. 


235 



What’s underneath this window outside ^ ” 

“ It’s a flagged path. I’m afraid you won’t find much there.” 

No , and it happens to be a spot that’s overlooked by absolutely 
nothing except those bathroom windows in the corndoi It’s very un- 
likely that the person should have been seen getting out If the letters 
had to be concocted in a lecture-room, this is as good a place as any 
Well ! I don’t see that we can do much here at the moment ” Harriet 
turned sharply on the two scouts “ You say you saw the person, Annie ” 
“ Not exactly saw her, madam, not to recognise She had on something 
black and was sittmg at the far table with her back to the door I thought 
she was writing ” 

“ Didn’t you see her face when she got up and came across to turn off 
thehght^” 

” No, madam I told Game what I saw and Game asked to look and 
bumped the door, and while I was tellmg her not to make a noise the 
light went out ” 

” Didn’t you see anything. Game ^ ” 

” WeU, I don’t hardly know, miss I was in such a fluster I saw the 
hght, and then I didn’t see nothing ” 

** Perhaps she crept round the wall to get to the light,” said the Dean 
“ Must have. Dean Will you go in and sit at the table on the chair 
that’s pulled out a bit, while I see what I can see from the door Then, 
when I knock on the glass, will you get up and out of sight as quickly as 
you can and work round to the switch and turn it off ^ Is the curtain 
much as it was, Anme, or did I disarrange it when I broke the glass ^ ” 
” I think It’s much the same, madam ” 

The Dean went m and sat down Harriet shut the door and put her 
eye to the chink m the curtain This was at the hinge side of the door, and 
gave her a sight of the window, the ends of the two tables and the place 
where the blackboard had stood beneath the window 

Have a look, Annie , was it like that ^ ” 

” Yes, madam Only the blackboard was standing up then, of course ” 
” Now — do as you did then Say to Came whatever it was you said, 
and Came, you knock on the door and then look in as you did the first 
time ” 

” Yes, madam I said * There she is • we’ve got her ’ And I jumped 
back like this ” 

Yes, and I said, ‘ Oh, dear f Let’s have a look ^ ’ — and then I sort 
of caught against Anme and knocked — ^like that ” 

” And I said, * Look out — ^now you’ve done it ’ ” 

” And I says, * Goo * * or somethmg hke that, and I looked in and I 
didn’t see nobody ” 

Gan you see anybody now ^ ” 

No, miss And I was trying to sec when the hght went out all of a 
sudden.” 

*86 



The light went out. 

“ How did that go off ^ asked the Dean, cautiously, with her mouth 
at the hole in the panel 

“ First-rate performance,” said Harriet “ Dead on time ” 

“ The second I heard the knock, I just nipped away to the right and 
crept round the wall Did you hear me ^ ” 

Not a sound You’ve got soft slippers on, haven’t you ^ ” 

“ We didn’t hear the other one either, miss ” 

She’d be wearing soft slippers, too Well, I suppose that settles that 
We’d better have a look round College to see that all’s well and get back 
to bed You two can be off now, Came — ^Miss Martm and I can see to 
things ” 

Very good, miss Gome along, Anme Though I’m sure I don’t 

know how anybody’s to get to sleep ” 

" Will you stop making that hi thy row * ” 

An exasperated voice heralded the appearance of an exceedingly 
angry student in pyjamas 

“ Do remember some people want to get a bit of rest at night This 

comdor’s a Oh, I’m sorry, Miss Martm Is anything wrong ^ *’ 

“ Nothmg at all, Miss Perry I’m so sorry we disturbed you Somebody 
left the lights on in the lecture-room and we came to see if it was all 
right ” 

The student vanished, with a jerk of a tousled head that showed what 
she thought of the matter The two servants went their way The Dean 
turned to Harriet 

“ Why all that business of reconstructing the crime ^ ” 

“ I wanted to find out whether Anme could really have seen what she 
said she saw These people sometimes let their imagination run away with 
them If you don’t mind, I’m going to lock these doors and remove the 
keys I’d rather hke a second opimon ” 

“ Aha » ” said the Dean ” The exquisite gentleman who kissed my feet 
in St Gross Road, crying, Vera tncessu patuit dean ^ ” 

“ That soxmds characteristic Well, Dean, you have got pretty feet I’ve 
noticed them ” 

“ They have been admired,” said the Dean, complacently, ** but 
seldom m so public a place or after five minutes’ acquaintance I said to 
his lordship, ‘ You are a foolish young man ’ He said, ‘ A man, certainly , 
and sometimes foolish enough to be young ’ * Well,’ I said, ‘ please get 
up , you can’t be young here ’ So then he said, very mcely, * I beg your 
pardon for behaving like a mountebank , I have no excuse to offer, so 
will you forgive me ^ ’ So I asked him to dinner ” 

Hamet shook her head 

** I’m afraid you’re susceptible to fair hair and a shm figure That 
m the slender’s but a humorous word which m the stout is flat un- 
pertmence 


237 



“ It might have been extremelv impertinent, but actually it was not 
I shall be interested to know what he makes of to-night’s affair We’d 
better go and see if there’s been any more funny business ” 

Nothing unusual was, however, to be observed 


Harriet rang up the Mitre before breakfast 

** Peter, could you possibly come round this morning instead of at 
SIX o’clock ^ ” 

“ Within five minutes, when and where you will ‘ If she bid them, 
they will go barefoot to Jerusalem, to the great Cham’s court, to the 
East Indies, to fetch her a bird to wear in her hat * Has anything 
happened ^ ” 

“ Nothing alarming , a htde evidence in situ But you may finish the 
bacon and eggs ” 

“ I will be at the Jowett Walk Lodge in half an hour ” 


He came accompanied by Bun ter and a camera Harriet took them 
into the Dean’s room and told them the story, with some assistance from 
Miss Martm, who asked whether he would like to interview the two 
scouts 

" Not for the moment You seem to have asked ail the necessary 
questions We’ll go and look at the room Theie’s no way to it, I take it, 
except along this passage Two doors on the left — students’ rooms, I 
suppose And one on the nght And the rest bathrooms and thmgs 
Which IS the door of the dark-room ^ This ^ In full view of the other door 
— so there was no escape except by the window. I see The key of the 
lecture-room was inside and the curtam left exactly like that ? You’re 
sure ^ All nght May I have the key ^ ” 

He threw the door open and glanced in 
Get a photograph of this, Bunter You have very nice, well-fitting 
doors in this building Oak No paint, no polish ” 

He took a lens from his pocket and ran it, rather perfunctorily, over 
the hght-switch and the door-handle 
“ Am I really going to see finger-pnnts discovered ^ ” asked the Dean 
“ Why, of course,” said Wimsey ” It won’t tell us anythmg, but it 
impresses the spectator and inspires confidence Bunter, the insufflator 
You will now see,” he pumped the white powder rapidly over the frame 
and handle of the door, “ how inveterate is the habit of catching hold of 
doors when you open them ” An astonishing number of superimposed 
prmts sprang into view above the lock as he blew the superfluous powder 
away “ Hence the excellent old-fashioned institution of the finger-plate 
May I borrow a chair from the bath-room ? . . Oh, thank you. Miss 

Vane ; I didn’t to fetch it.” 



He extended the blowing operations nght up to the top of the door and 
the upper edge of the frame 

“You surely don’t expect to find finger-pnnts up there,” said the Dean 
“ Nothing would surprise me more This is merely a shop-wundow 
display of thoroughness and efficiency All a matter of routine, as the 
policeman says Your college is kept very well dusted , I congratulate 
you Weil, that’s that We wall now direct our straining eyes to the dark- 
room door and do the same thing there The key ^ Thank you Fewer 
prints here, you see I deduce that the room is usually approached by 
way of the lecture-room That probably also accounts for the presence 
of dust along the top of the door Something always gets overlooked, 
doesn’t it ^ The linoleum, however, has been honourably swept and 
polished Must I go down on my knees and do the floor-w^alk for foot- 
prints ^ It IS shockingly bad for one’s trousers and seldom useful Let us 
rather examine the window Yes — somebody certainly seems to have got 
out here But we knew that already She climbed over the sink and 
knocked that beaker off the drainmg-board ” 

“ She trod m the sink,” said Harriet, “ and left a damp smear on the 
sill It’s dried up now, of course ” 

“ Yes , but that proves she really did get out this way and at that time 
Though It scarcely needed proving There ts no other way out This isn’t 
the old problem of a hermetically-sealed chamber and a body Have you 
finished m there, Bunter ^ ” 

“ Yes, my lord , I have made three exposures ” 

“ That ought to do You might clean those doors, would you ” He 
turned, smiling, on the Dean “ You see, even if we did identify all those 
finger-pnnts, they would all belong to people who had a perfect nght to 
be here And in any case, our culpnt, like everybody else these days, 
probably knows enough to wear gloves ” 

He surveyed the lecture-room cnticaily 
“ Miss Vane * ” 

« Yes ^ ” 

“ Something womed you about this room What was it ^ ” 

“ You don’t need to be told ” 

“ No , I am convinced that our two hearts beat as one But tell Miss 
Martin ” 

“ When the Poison-Pen turned off the light, she must have been close 
to the door Then she went out by way of the dark-room Why did she 
knock over the blackboard, which is nght out of the hne between the 
two doors ^ ” 

“ Exactly ” 

“ Oh ! ” cned the Dean, “ but that’s nothing One often loses one’s 
way in a dark room My reading-lamp fused one night, and I got up to 
try and find the wall-switch and brought up with my nose against the 
wardrobe ” 

m 



There * ” said Wxmsey “ The chill voice of common sense falls on 
our conjectures like cold water on hot glass, and shatters them to bits 
But I don’t believe it She had only to feel her way along the wall She 
must have had some reason for going back into the middle of the room 
“ She’d left somethmg on one of the tables ” 

“ That’s more hkely But what ^ Something identifiable ” 

A handkerchief or something that she’d been using to press down 
the letters as she pasted them on ” 

“ We’ll say it was that These papers are just as you found them, I 
imagine Did you test them to see if the paste was stiU wet ^ ” 

“ I just felt tins unfinished one on the floor You see how it’s done She 
drew a line of paste right across the paper and then dabbed the letters on 
The unfimshed hne was just tacky, hut not wet But then, you see, we 
didn’t get in till after she’d been gone five or ten minutes ” 

“ You didn’t test any of the others ^ ” 

** I’m afraid not ” 

“ I only wondered how long she’d been working here She’s managed 
to get through a good bit But we may be able to find out another way ” 
He took up the box-lid contaimng the odd letters 
** Rough brown cardboard , I don’t think we’ll bother to look for 
finger-pnnts on this Or to trace it , it nught have come from anywhere 
She’d nearly finished her job , there are only a couple of dozen letters 
left, and a lot of them are Q,’s and K’s and Z’s and such-like unhandy 
consonants I wonder how this last message was meant to end ” 

He picked the paper from the floor and turned it over. 

“ Addressed to you, Miss Vane Is this the first time you have been 
honoured ^ 

The first time — since the first time ” 

** Ah ^ ‘You needn’t think you’ll get me, you make me laugh, you 
. . ’ Well, the epithet remains to be supplied— from the letters m the 
box. If your vocabulary is large enough you may discover what it was 
going to be.” 

“ But . Lord Peter ” 

It was so long since she had addressed him by his title that she felt 
self*conBcious about it But she appreciated his formahty 
“ What I want to know is, why she came to this room at all.” 

“ That IS the mystery, isn’t it ^ ” 

There was a shaded reading-lamp on the table, and he stood idly 
chekmg the light on and off ” Yes Why couldn’t she do it m her own 
room ^ Why invite discovery ^ ” 

“ Excuse me, my lord ” 

“ Yes, Bunter ^ ” 

“ Would this be any contribution to the inquiry 
Bunter dived beneath the table and came up, holding a long black 
hairpm 



Good heavens, Bunter * This is like a leaf out of a forgotten story 
How many people use these things ^ 

“ Oh, quite a number, nowadays,” said the Dean, “ Little buns in the 
neck have come back I use them myself, but mine are bronze ones And 
some of the students And Miss Lydgate — but I think hers are bronze, 
too ” 

“ I know who uses black ones this shape,” said Harriet “ I once had 
the pleasure of sticking them in for her ” 

“ Miss de Vine, of couise Always the White Queen And she would 
drop them all over the place But I should think she was about the only 
person in College who would never, by any chance, come into this room 
She gives no lectures or classes and never uses the dark-room or consults 
scientific works ” 

“ She was working in her room when I came across last night,” said 
Harriet 

“ Did you see her ^ ” said Wimsey, quickly 

“ Dm sorry I’m an idiot I only meant that her reading-lamp was on, 
close to her window ” 

“ You can’t establish an alibi on the strength of a reading-lamp,” 
said Wimsey “I’m afraid I shall have to do the floor- walk after all ” 

It was the Dean who picked up a second hairpin — in the place where 
one might most reasonably expect to find it — in a comer near the sink 
in the dark-room She was so pleased with herself as a detective that 
she almost forgot the implications of the discovery, till Harriet’s dis- 
tressed exclamation forced them upon her 

“ We haven’t identified the hairpins for certain,” said Peter, com- 
fortingly “ That Will be a little task for Miss Vane ” He gathered up the 
papers “ I’ll take these and add them to the dossier I suppose there’s no 
message for us on the blackboard ^ ” 

He picked up the board, which contamed only a few chemical 
formulae, scnbbled m chalk, in Miss Edwards’s handwnting, and 
restored the easel to an upnght position, on the far side of the window 

“ Look * ” said Harriet, suddenly “ I know why she went roimd that 
way. She meant to get out by the lecture-room wmdow, and had for- 
gotten the bars It was only when she pulled the curtain aside and saw 
them that she remembered the dark-room and plunged away m a hurry, 
knocking over the blackboard and tumbhng into the chairs on the way 
She must have been between the wmdow and the easel, because the 
board and the easel fell forward into the room, and not backwards 
towards the wall ” 

Peter looked at her thoughtfully Then he went back into the dark- 
room and lowered and raised the wmdow-sash It moved easily and 
almost in silence 

“ If this place wasn’t so well built,” he said, almost accusingly, to the 
Dean, “ somebody would have heard this wmdow go up and run round 

24X 



m time to catch the lady As it is, I wonder that Anme didn’t notice the 
noise of the beaker faiimg into the sink But if she did, she probably 
thought It was something in the lecture-room— one of those glass cases 
or what not Tou didn’t hear anything after you arrived, did you ? ” 

** Not a thing ” 

“ Then she must have got out while Game was fetching you out of 
bed I suppose nobody saw her go ” 

“ I’ve asked the only three students whose windows overlook that wall, 
^nd they saw nothing,” said Harriet 
“ Wen, you might ask Anme about the beaker And ask both of them 
whether they noticed, as they came past, if the dark-room window was 
open or shut I don’t suppose they noticed anythmg, but you never can 
tell ” 

“ What does it matter ^ ” asked the Dean 
Not very much But if it was shut, it rather supports Miss Vane’s idea 
about the blackboard If it was open, it would suggest that a retreat had 
been planned in that direction It’s a question of whether we’re dealing 
with a short-sighted or a long-sighted person — mentally, I mean And 
you might inquire at the same time whether any of the other women in 
the Scouts’ Wing saw the light in the lecture-room, and if so, how early ” 
Hamet laughed 

“ I can tell you that at once None of them If they had, there would 
have been an eager rush to tell us all about it You may be perfecdy 
certain that Annie’s and Game’s adventure formed the staple of 
conversation m the servants’ halllthis morning ’* 

That,” said his lordship, “ is very true indeed ” 

There was a pause The lecture-room seemed to offer no further field 
for research Hamet suggested that Wimsey might like to look round the 
College 

“ I was about to suggest it,” said he, “ if you can spare the time ” 

“ Miss Lydgate is expecting me in half an hour for a fresh attack on 
the Frosody^^ said Harriet I mustn’t cut that, because her time is so 
preaous, poor dear, and she’s suddenly thought of a new appendix.” 

“ Oh, no * ” cned the Dean 

“ Alas, yes * But we could just go round and view the more important 
battlefields ” 

I should like particularly to see the Hall and Library and the con- 
nection between them, the entrance to Tudor Building, with Miss 
Barton’s former room, the lay-out of the Chapel with reference to the 
postern and the place where, with the help of God, one leaps over the 
wall, and the way from Queen Elizabeth into the New Quad ” 

Great Heavens * ” said Hamet Did you sit up ail night with the 
dossier ? ” 

Hush » no, I woke rather early But don’t let Bunter hear, or he will 
Start being solicitous Men have died and the worms have eaten them, 
^ 4 ^ 



but not for early nsing In fact, it is said tnat it’s the early worm that 
gets the bird 

You remind me,” said the Dean, ** that tnere a**e ha^f a dozen worms 
waitmg in my room to get the bird this moute Three a e-w t^oat 
leaves, two gramophones-out-of-doois, and ar ^rreguiar mo*or-vemcle 
We shall meet again at dinner, Lord Peter ’ 

She ran briskly away to deal with the male'acto’^ ^eav'^rg Peter and 
Harriet to make their tour From Peter’s comments, Ha-rzC* couL_d make 
out little of his mind , she fancied, indeed, tna* ne was somewhat 
abstracted from the matter in hand 

“ I fancy,” he said at last, as they came to the Jowett Walk Lodge, 
where he had left the car, “ that you will have ver) lude more trouble 
at night ” 

“ Why ^ ” 

Well, for one thing, the nights are getting \erv snort, and the nsks 
very great 411 the same — shall you be offer a ed if I ask you — if I 
suggest that you should take some personal precaui'cns ^ ” 

“ What sort of precautions ^ ” 

“ I won’t offer you a revolver to take to bed w*th you But I na\ e an 
idea that from now on you and at least one other person ma> be in some 
danger of attack That may be imagination But if this joker is alarmed 
and bottled up for a bit — and I think she has been alarmed — the next 
outrage may be a serious one — when it comes ” 

Weil,” said Harriet, “ we have her word for it that she finds me 
merely funny ” 

His attention seemed to be attracted by sometmng among the aash- 
board fittings, and he said, looking not at her but at the car 
‘‘Yes But without any vanity, I wish I were your husband or your 
brother or your lover, or anything but what I am ’ 

“ You mean, your being here is a danger — to me ^ ” 

“ I dare say I’m flattermg myself^’ 

“ But it wouldn’t stop to damage me ” 

“ She may not think very clearly about that ” 

“ Weil, I don’t mind the risk, if it is one And I don’t see why it would 
be any less if you were a relation of mine,” 

“ There’d be an innocent excuse for my presence, wouldn’t there ^ 
Don’t think I’m trymg to make capital out of this on my own 
account I’m being careful to observe the formalities, as vou ma\ hav e 
noticed I’m only warmng you that I’m sometimes a dangerous person 
to know ” 

“ Let’s have this clear, Peter You think that your being here may 
make this person desperate and that she may try to take it out of me. 
And you are trying to tell me, very delicately, that it might be safer if we 
camouflaged your interest m the case as another kind of interest ” 

“ Safer for you ” 


243 



“ Yes — ^though I canH see why you think so But you’re sure Pd rather 
die than make such an embarrassing pretence ” 

** Wellj wouldn’t you ^ *’ 

“ And on the whole you’d rather see me dead than embarrassed ” 
That IS probably another form of egotism But I am entirely at your 
service ” 

** Of course, if you’re such a perilous ally, I could tell you to go away ” 
** I can see you urgmg me to go away and leave a job undone ” 

“ Well, Peter, Pd certainly rather die than make any sort of pretence 
to you or about you But I think you’re exaggerating the whole thing 
You don’t usually get the wmd up like this ” 

“ I do, though , quite often But if it’s only my own risk, I can afford 

to let It blow When it comes to other people ” 

“ Your instinct is to clap the women and children under hatches ” 

“ Well,” he admitted, deprecatmgly, “ one can’t suppress one’s 
natural instincts altogether , even if one’s reason and self-interest are all 
the other way ” 

“ Peter, it’s a shame Let me introduce you to some mce little woman 
who adores being protected ” 

“ I should be wasted on her Besides, she would always be deceiving 
me, in the kindest manner, for my own good , and that I could not 
stand I object to being tactfully managed by somebody who ought to be 
my equal. If I want tactful dependents, I can hire them And fire them 
if they get too tactful I don’t mean Bunter He braces me by a continual 
cold shower of silent cnticism I don’t protect him , he protects me, and 
preserves an independent judgment . However , without presummg 
to be protective, may I yet suggest that you should use a reasonable 
caution ^ I tell you franldy, I don’t like your friend’s pre-occupation 
with kmves and stranghng ” 

“ Are you senous ^ ” 

For once ” 

Harriet was about to tell him not to be ridiculous , she remem- 
bered Miss Barton’s story about the strong hands that had seized her from 
behind It might have been quite true The thought of perambulatmg 
the long corridors by mght was suddenly disagreeable 
“ Very weU , I’ll be careful ” 

** I think it would be wise I’d better push off now I’ll be round in 
time to face the High Table at dmner Seven o’clock ^ ” 

She nodded He had interpreted stnctly her injunction to come ** this 
mormng instead of at six ” She went, feehng a little blank, to cope with 
Miss Lydgate’s proofs.

CHAPTER XVII 


He that questioneth much shall leam much, and content much , 
but especially if he apply his questions to the skill of the peraons 
whom he asketh , for he shall give them occasion to please them- 
selves m speaking, and himself shall contmually gather know- 
ledge But let his questions not be troublesome, for that is fit for a 
poser , and let him be sure to leave other men their turns to 
speak 

FRANCIS BACON 

“ You look,*’ said the Dean, “ like a nervous parent whose little boy is 
about to recite The Wreck of the Hesperus at a School Concert *’ 

** I feel,” said Harriet, “ more like the mother of Daniel 

King Danus said to the lions — 

Bite Darnel Bite Darnel 
Bite him Bite him Bite him.” 

“ G’rrrrr » ” said the Dean. 

They were standing at the door of the Semor Common Room, winch 
convemently overlooked the Jowett Walk Lodge The Old Quad was 
animated Late-comers were hurrying over to change for dinner , others, 
having changed, were strollmg about m groups, waiting for the bell ; 
some were still playing tennis , Miss de Vme emerged from the Librar>- 
Building, still vaguely pushing m hairpins (Harriet had checked up on 
those hairpins and identified them) , an elegant figure paraded towards 
them from the direction of the New Quadrangle 
“ Miss Shaw’s got a new frock,’* said Harriet 
“ So she has * How posh of her * 

And she was as fine as a melon m the corn-field, 

Ghding and lovely as a ship upon the sea 

That, my dear, is meant for Darnel ” 

“ Dean, darhng, you’re bemg a cat ” 

‘‘ Well, aren’t we all ^ This early arrival of everybody is exceedingly 
sinister Even Miss Hillyard is arrayed in her best bfeck gown witn a 
train to it. We all feel there’s safety m numbers ” 

It was not out of the way for the Semor Common Room to collect 
outside their own door before dinner of a fine summer’s day, but Harriet, 
glancmg round, had to admit that there were more of them there that 
cvenmg than was usual before 7 o’clock She thought they all seemed 
apprehensive and some even hostile They tended to avoid one another’s 

245 



eyes , yet they gathered together as though for protection against a 
common menace She suddenly found it absurd that anybody should be 
alarmed by Peter Wimsey , she saw them as a harmless collection of 
nervous patients m a dentist’s waiting-room 
“ We seem,” said Miss Pyke’s harsh voice in her ear, “ to be pre- 
paring a somewhat formidable reception for our guest Is he of a timid 
disposition ^ ” 

“ I should say he was completely hard-boiled,” said Harriet 

“ That reminds me,” said the Dean “ In the matter of shirt-fronts ” 

“ Hard, of course,” 'said Harriet, indignantly “ And if he pops or 
bulges, I will pay you five pounds ” 

“ 1 have been meamng to ask you,” said Miss Pyke “ How is the 
popping sound occasioned ^ I did not like to ask Dr Threep so personal 
a question, but my curiosity was very much aroused ” 

“ You’d better ask Lord Peter,” said Harriet 

“ If you think he will not be oflfended,” replied Mhss Pyke, with perfect 
seriousness, ” I will do so ” 

The chimes of New GoEege, rather out of tune, played the four quarters 
and struck the hour 

“ Punctuality,” said the Dean, her eyes turned towards the Lodge, 
** seems to be one of the gentleman’s virtues You’d better go and meet 
him and settle his nerves before the ordeal ” 

“ Do you think so ^ ” Hamet shook her head “ Ye’ll no fickle 
Tammas Yownie ” 

It may, perhaps, be embarrassing for a solitary man to walk across a 
wide quadrangle under a fire of glances from a collection of collegiate 
females , but it is child’s play compared, for example^ vsath the long trek 
from the pavilion at Lord’s to the far end of the pitch, with five wickets 
down and ninety needed to save the follow-on Thousands of people then 
alive might have recognised that easy and unhurned stride and confident 
carnage of the head Harnet let him do three-quarters of the journey 
alone, and then advanced to meet him 
** Have you cleaned your teeth and said your prayers ^ ” 

Yes, mamma , and cut my nails and washed behmd the cars and got 
a dean handkerchief” 

Looking at a bunch of students who happened to pass at the moment, 
Hamet wished she could have said the same of them They were grubby 
and dishevelled and she felt unexpectedly obliged to Miss Shaw for 
having made an effort in the matter of dress As for her convoy, from his 
sleek yellow head to his pumps she distrusted him , his mood of the 
morning was gone, and he was as ready for mischief as a wilderness of 
monkeys 

” Come along then, and behave prettily. Have you seen your 
nephew ^ ** 

“ I have seen him My bankruptcy will probably be announced 
246 



to-morrow He asked me to give you his love, no doubt thinking I can 
still be lavish m that commodity It ail returned from him to you though 
It was mine before* That colour is very becoming to you*’’ 

His tone was pleasantly detached and she hoped he was referring to 
her dress , but she was not sure She was glad to relinquish him to the 
Dean, who came forward to claim him and to relieve her of the intro- 
ductions Harriet watched m some amusement Miss Lydgate, far too 
unselfconscious to have any attitude at all, greeted him exactly as she 
would have greeted anybody else, and asked eagerly about the situation 
m Central Europe , Miss Shaw smiled with a graciousness that empha- 
sised Miss Stevens’s brusque How-d’ye-do ” and immediate retreat 
into ammated discussion of college affairs with Miss Allison , Miss Pyke 
pounced on him with an intelligent question about the latest murder , 
Miss Barton, advancing with an evident determination to put him right 
about capital punishment, was disarmed by the blank amiabihtv of the 
countenance ofFeied for her inspection and observed instead that it had 
been a remarkably fine day 

“ Comedian < ” thought Harriet, as Miss Barton, finding she could 
make nothing of him, passed him on to Miss Hiiiyard 

“ Ah • ” said Wimsey instantly, smiling into the Historv Tutor’s sulky 
eyes, “ this is delightful Your paper in the Historical Revuw on the 
diplomatic aspects of the Divorce * ” 

(Heavens ^ thought Harriet, I hope he knows his stuff ) 

‘‘ really masterly Indeed, I felt that, if anything, you had 
slightly underestimated the pressure brought to bear upon Clement 
by ” 

“ consulted the unedited dispatches in the possession of . ” 

“ . • you might have earned the argument a trifle farther You 

very nghtiy point out that the Emperor . ” 

(Yes , he had read the article ail right ) 

disfigured by prejudice, but a considerable authority on the 
Canon Law * ” 

“ needing to be thoroughly overhauled and re-edited Innumer- 

able mistranscriptions and at least one unscrupulous omission 
“ , if at any time you require access, I could probably put you 

in touch with official channels • personal introduction • 
raise no difficulties ” 

“ Miss Hillyard,” said the Dean to Hamet, ‘‘ looks as though she had 
been given a birthday present ” 

“ I think he’s offering her access to some out-of-the-way source of 
information ” (After all, she thought, he is Somebody, though one never 
seems able to remember it ) 

not so much political as economic ” 

Ah ’ ” said Miss Hillyard, ‘‘ wh^n it comes to a question of national 
flnance. Miss de Vine is the real authority ” 

247 



She effected the introduction herself, and the discussion continued 
** Well/^ said the Dean, “ he has made a complete conquest of Miss 
Hillyard » 

“ And Miss de Vine is making a complete conquest of him ** 

“ It’s mutual, I fancy At any rate, her back hair’s coming down, 
which IS a sure sign of pleasure and excitement ” 

“ Yes,” said Hamet Wimsey was arguing with intelligence about the 
appropriation of monastic fun^, but she had little doubt that the back 
of his mind was full of hairpins 

“ Here comes the Warden We shall have to separate them forcibly 
He’s got to face Dr Banng and take her in to dinner All’s well 
She has collared him That firm assertion of the Royal Prerogative * 
. Do you want to sit next him and hold his hand ^ ” 

** I don’t think he needs any assistance from me You’re the person 
for him. Not a suspect, but full of hvely information ” 

“ All nght , I’ll go and prattle to him You’d better sit opposite to us 
and kick me if I say anything indiscreet ” 

By this arrangement, Harriet found herself placed a little uncomfort- 
ably between Miss Hillyard (in whom she always felt an antagonism to 
herself) and Miss Barton (who was obviously still worried about Wimsey’s 
detective hobbies), and face to face with the two people whose glances 
were most likely to disturb her gravity On the other side of the Dean 
sat Miss Pyke , on the other side of Miss Hillyard was Miss de Vme, well 
under Wimsey’s eye Miss Lydgate, that secure fortress, was situated at 
the far end of the table, offenng no kind of refuge 
Neither Miss Hillyard nor Miss Barton had much to say to Harriet, 
who was thus able to follow, without too much difficulty, the Warden’s 
straightforward determination to size up Wimsey and Wimsey’s diplo- 
matically veiled but equally obstmate determination to size up the 
Warden , a contest earned on with unwavenng courtesy on either side 
Dr Banng began by mqmnng whether Lord Peter had been con- 
ducted over the College and what he thought of it, adding, with due 
modesty that architecturaUy, of course, it could scarcely hope to compete 
with the more ancient foundations 

“ Gonsidenng,” said his lordship plaintively, “ that the architecture of 
my own anaent foxmdation is mathematically compounded of ambition, 
distraction, uglification and dension, that remark sounds like sarcasm,” 
The Warden, almost seduced into beheving herself giulty of a breach 
of manners, earnestly assured him that she had intended no personal 
allusion 

” An occasional reminder is good for us,” said he “ We are mortified 
in nmeteenth-century Gothic, lest m our overweemng Balliolity we 
forget God We pulled down the good to make way for the bad , you, on 
the contrary, have made the world out of nothing — z more divine 
procedure,” 

5148 



The Warden, manceuvrmg uneasily on this shppery ground bet’ween 
jest and earnest, found foothold 

** It IS quite true that we have had to make what we can out of very 
little — and that, you know, is tvpical of our whole position here ” 

“ Yes , you are practically without er dowments ^ 

The question was so offerea as to include the Dean, who said 
cheerfully 

“ Quite right All done by cheeseparing ” 

‘‘ That being so,” he said, seriously, “ even to admire seems to be a 
kind of impertinence This is a very fine hall — who is the architect ? ” 
The Warden supplied him with a little local history, breaking off to 
say 

‘‘ But probably you are not specially interested in all this question of 
women’s education ” 

Is it still a question ^ It ought not to be I hope you are not going to 
ask me whether I approve of women’s domg this and that ” 

“ Why not ^ ” 

You should not imply that I have any right either to approi^e or 
disapprove ” 

I assure you,” said the Warden, “ that even in Oxfoid we still 
encounter a certain number of people who maintain their right to 
disapprove ” 

‘ And I had hoped I was returmng to civilisation ” 

The removal of fish-plates caused a slight diversion, and the Warden 
took the opportumty to turn her inquiries upon the situation in Europe. 
Here the guest was on his own ground Harnet caught the Dean’s eye and 
smiled But the more formidable challenge was coming International 
pohtics led to history, and history — m Dr Baring’s mind — to philosophy. 
The ominous name of Plato suddenly emerged from a tangle of words, 
and Dr Baring moved out a philosophical speculation, like a pawn, and 
planted it temptingly en prise 

Many persons had plunged to irretrievable disaster over the Warden’s 
philosophic pavm There were two ways of takmg it both disastrous. 
One was to pretend to knowledge , the other, to profess an insincere 
eagerness for instruction His lordship smiled gently and refused the 
gambit 

That IS out of my stars I have not the philosophic mind ” 

** And how would you define the philosophic mmd, Lord Peter ^ ” 

“ I wouldn’t , definitions are dangerous But I know that philosophy 
IS a closed book to me, as music is to the tone-deaf ” 

The Warden looked at him quickly , he presented her with an innocent 
profile, drooping and contemplative over his plate, hke a heron brooding 
by a pond 

A very apt illustration,” said the Warden , ” as it happens, I am 
tone-deaf myself ” 


249 



“ Are you ^ I tliought you might he said, equably 
** That IS very interesting How can you tell ^ ” 

** There is something in the quality of the voice ” He offered candid 
grey eyes for examination But it’s not a very safe conclusion to d^aw, 
and, as you may have noticed, I didn’t draw it That is the art of the 
charlatan — to induce a confession and present it as the result of 
deduction ” 

“ I see,” said Dr Barmg “ You expose your technique very frankly ” 
** You would have seen through it in any case, so it is better to expose 
one’s seif and acquire an unmerited reputation for candour The great 
advantage about telling the truth is that nobody ever believes it — that 
IS at the bottom of the iffeyBrj Xiy€iv (hs 8a ” 

** So there is one philosopher whose books are not closed to you ^ 
Next time, I will start by w^ay of Anstotle ” 

She turned to her left-hand neighbour and released him 
** I am sorry,” said the Dean, “ we have no strong drink to offer you ” 
His face was eloquent of mingled apprehension and mischief 
The toad beneath the harrow knows where every separate tooth 
point goes Do you always prove your guests with hard questions ^ ” 

“ Till they show themselves to be Solomons You have passed the test 
with great credit ” 

” Hush * there is only one kind of wisdom that has any social value, 
and that is the knowledge of one’s own limitations ” 

“ Nervous young dons and students have before now been carried out 
m convulsions through being afraid to say boldly that they did not 
know ” 

** Showing themselves,” said Miss Pyke across the Dean, “ less wise 
than Socrates, who made the admission fairly frequently ” 

“For Heaven’s sake,” said Wimsey, “don’t mention Socrates It 
might start all over again ” 

“ Not now,” said the Dean “ She will ask no questions now except for 
instruction ” 

“ There is a question on which I am anxious to be instructed,” said 
Miss Pyke, “ if you will not take it amiss ” 

Miss Pyke, of course, was still worned about Dr Threep’s shirt-front, 
and determined on getting enlightenment Harriet hoped that Wimsey 
would recognise her cunosity for what it was not skittishness, but the 
embarrassmg appetite for exact information which characterises the 
scholarly mind 

“ That phenomenon,” he said, readily, “ comes within my own sphere 
of knowledge It occurs because the human torso possesses a higher 
factor of vanability than the ready-made shirt The explosive sound you 
mention is produced when the shirt-front is slightly too long for the 
wearer. The stiff edges, being forced slightly apart by the inclination of 
the body come back into contact with a sharp click, similar to that 

aso 



emitted by the elytra of ceitain beetles It is not to be confiisedj however, 
with the ticking of the Death-watch, which is made by tapping with the 
jaws and is held to be a lo\e-caii The clicking of the shirt-front has no 
amatory sigmficance, and is, indeed, an embarrassment to the insect It 
may be obviated by an increased care m selection or, m extreme cases, 
by having the garment made to measure ” 

** Thank you so much,” said Miss Pvke “ Tnat is a most satisfactory 
explanation At this time of day, it is perhaps not improper to adduce tne 
parallel instance of the old-fashioned corset, which was suDject to a 
sinular inconvenience ” 

The inconvenience ” added Wimsey, “was even greater m the case 
of plate armour, which had to be very well tailored to allow of movement 
at all ” 

At this point, Miss Baiton captured Harnet’s attention witn some 
remark or other, and she lost tiack of the conversation on the other side 
of the table When she picked up the threads again, Miss P>ke was 
giving her neighbours some cunous details about Ancient Minoan 
civilisation, and the Warden was apparently waiting till she had finished 
to pounce on Peter again Tuinmg to her right, Harriet saw that Miss 
Hillyard was watching the group with a curiously concentrated expres- 
sion Harriet asked her to pass the sugar, and she came back to earth 
with a slight start 

“ They seem to be getting on very w^ell over there,” said Harnet 
“ Miss Pyke likes an audience,” said Miss Hillyard, with so much 
venom that Harnet was quite astonished 
“ It’s good for a man to have to do the listemng sometimes,” she 
suggested 

Miss Hiliyaid agreed absently After a slight pause, during which 
dinner proceeded without inadent, she said 
“ Your friend tells me he can obtain access for me to some pnvate 
collections of historical documents in Florence Do you suppose he means 
what he says ^ ” 

“ If he says so, you may be sure he can and will ” 

“ That IS a testimomal,” said Miss Hillyard “ I am very glad to hear 
It ” 

Meanwhile, the Warden had effected her capture, and was talking to 
Peter in a low tone and with some earnestness He listened attentively, 
while he peeled an apple, the narrow coils of the nnd sliding slowlv over 
his fingers She concluded with some question , and he shook his head 
“ It is very unhkeiy I should say there was no hope of it at all ” 
Harnet wondered whether the subject of the Poison-Pen had risen at 
last to the surface , but presently he said 
“ Three hundred years ago it mattered comparatively little. But now 
that you have the age of national self-realisation, the age of colonial 
expansion, the age of the barbarian mvasions and the age of the decline 



and fall, all jammea cheek by jowl m time and space, all armed alike 
with poison-gas and gomg through the outward motions of an advanced 
civilisation, pnnciples have become more dangerous than passions It*s 
getting uncommonly easy to kill people in large numbers, and the first 
thing a pnnciple does — if it really is a principle — ^is to kill somebody ” 

“ * The real tragedy is not the conflict of good with evil but of good 
with good * , that means a problem with no solution 
** Yes Af^cting, of course, to the tidy mind One may either huiloo 
on the inevitable, and be called a bloodthirsty progressive , or one may 
try to gain time and be called a bloodthirsty reactionary But when blood 
IS their argument, all argument is apt to be — ^merely bloody 
The Warden passed the adjective at its face-value 
“ I sometimes wonder whether we gain anything by gaining time ” 

“ Well — if one leaves letters unanswered long enough some of them 
answer themselves Nobody can prevent the Fall of Troy, but a dull, 
careful person may manage to smuggle out the Lares and Penates — even 
at the risk of having the epithet tacked to his name 
“ The Universities are always being urged to march in the van of 
progress ” 

“ But epic actions are all fought by the rearguard — at Roncevaux and 
Thermopylae ” 

“ Very well,” said the Warden, laughing, “ let us die in our tracks, 
having accomplished nothing but an epic ” 

She collected the High Table with her eye, rose, and made a stately 
exit Peter effaced himself politely against the panelhng while the dons 
filed past him, arriving at the edge of the dais in time to pick up Miss 
Shaw’s scarf as it slipped from her shoulders Harriet found herself 
descendmg the staircase between Miss Martin and Miss de Vine, who 
remarked ^ 

“ You are a courageous woman ” 

** Why ? ” said Harriet hghtly “ To bnng my friends here and have 
them put to the question ^ ” 

” Nonsense,” interrupted the Dean. “ We all behaved beautifully 
Darnel is still uneaten — ^in fact, at one point he bit the hon Was that 
genuine, by the way ^ ” 

“ About tone-de^ness ^ Probably just a little more genuine than he 
made out ” 

” Will he lay traps all evemng for us to walk into ^ ” 

Harnet realised for a moment how queer the whole situation was 
Once again, she felt Wimsey as a dangerous alien and herself on the side 
of the women who, with so strange a generosity, were welcoming the 
inqmsitor among them She said, however 

“ If he does, he will display all the mechamsm m the most obhgmg 
manner ” 

** After one is inside. That’s very comfortmg ” 

«52 



“ Thatj^* said Miss de Vine, brushing aside these suiface commentaries, 
“ IS a man able to subdue himself to his own ends I should be sorry for 
anyone who came up against hts principles — ^whatever they are, and if 
he has any ” 

She detached herself from the othei two, and went on into the Senior 
Common Room with a sombre face 

Curious,” said Harriet “ She is saying about Peter Wimsey exactly 
what I have always thought about herself ” 

“ Perhaps she recognises a kindred spirit ” 

“ Or a foe worthy of— -I ought not to say that ” 

Here Peter and his compamon caught them up, and the Dean, joining 
Miss Shaw, went on in with her Wimsey smiled at Harriet, an odd, 
interrogative smile 
“ What*s worrying you ? ” 

“ Peter — I feel exactly like Judas ” 

“ Feehng like Judas is part of the job No job for a gentleman, Pm 
afraid Snail we wash our hands hke Pilate and be thoroughly 
respectable ^ ** 

She slid her hand under his arm 
“ No , we’re m for it now We’ll be degraded together ” 

“ That will be mce Like the lovers in that Stroheim film, we’ll go and 
sit on the sewer ” She could feel his bone and muscle, reassurmgly human, 
under the fine broadcloth She thought “ He and I belong to the same 
world, and all these others are the aliens ” And then “ Damn it all ’ 
this is our private fight — why should they have to join in ^ ** But that 
was absurd 

What do you want me to do, Peter ^ ” 

** Chuck the ball back to me if it runs out of the circle Not obviously 
Just exeicise your devastating talent for keeping to the point and 
speaking the truth ” 

” That sounds easy ” 

“ It IS — for you That’s what I lo\e you for Didn’t you know ^ Well, 
we can’t stop to argue about it now , they’ll think we’ie conspirmg about 
something ” 

She released his arm and went into the room ahead of him, feeling 
suddenly embarrassed and lookmg, in comequence, defiant The coffee 
was already on the table, and the SCR were gathered about it, helping 
themselves She saw Miss Barton advance upon Peter, with a courteous 
offer of refreshment on her lips but the light of determination in her eye 
Hamet did not for the moment care w^hat happened to Peter He had 
given her a new bone to worry She provided herself with coffee and a 
cigarette, and retired with them and the bone into a corner She had 
often wondered, m a detached kind of way, what it was that Peter 
valued in her and had apparently valued from that first day when she 
had stood in the dock and spoken for her own life Now that she knew, 

m 



she thought that a more unattractive pair of qualities couM seldom have 
been put forward as an excuse for devotion 

** But do you really feel comfortable about it, Lord Peter ^ ” 

« No—I shouldn’t recommend it as a comfortable occupation But is 
your or my or anybody’s comfort of very great importance ^ ” 

Miss Barton probably took that for flippancy , Harnet recognised the 
ruthless voice that had said, What does it matter if it hurts ? ” 
Let them fight it out Unattractive , but if he meant what he said, 
it explained a great many things Those were qualities that could be 
recognised under the most sordid conditions Detachment . 

if you ever find a person who likes you because of it, that liking is sincere ” 
That was Miss de Vine , and Miss de Vine was sitting not very far away, 
her eyes, behind their thick glasses, fixed on Peter with a curious, 
calculating look 

Conversations, earned on in groups, were beginning to falter and fail 
into silence People were sitting down The voices of Miss Allison and 
Miss Stevens rose into prominence They were discussing some collegiate 
question, and they were doing it intently and desperately They called 
upon Miss Burrows to give an opimon Miss Shaw turned to !Miss Ghil- 
penc and made a remark about the bathing at Spinsters’ Splash ” 
Miss Chilpenc replied elaborately — too elaborately , her answer took 
too long and attracted attention , she hesitated, became confused, and 
stopped speakmg Miss Lydgate, with a troubled face, was listening to an 
anecdote that Mrs Goodwin was telling about her little boy , in the 
middle of it, Miss IIiHyard, who was within earshot, rose pointedly, 
stabbed out her cigarette on a distant ash-tray, and moved slowly, and 
as though despite herself, to a window-seat close to where Miss Barton 
was still standing Hamet could see her angry, smouldering glance fix 
Itself on Peter’s bent head and then jerk away across the quad, only to 
return again Miss Edwards, close to Harriet and a little in front of her 
on a low chair, had her hands set squarely and rather mannishly on her 
knees, and was leamng forward , she had the air of waiting for something 
Miss Pyke, on her feet, hghting a cigarette, was apparently looking for an 
opportunity to engage Peter’s attention , she appeared eager and inter- 
ested, and more at her ease than most of the others The Dean, curled on 
a humpty, was frankly listemng to what Peter and Ivliss Barton were 
saying They were all listemng, really, and at the same time most of them 
were trying to pretend that he was there as an ordinary guest — that he 
was not an enemy — not a spy They were trying to prevent him from 
becoming openly the centre of attention as he was already the centre of 
consciousness. 

The Warden, seated in a deep chair near the fireplace, gave nobody 
any help One by one, the spurts of talk failed and died, leaving the one 
tenor floatmg, like a solo instrument executing a cadenza when the 
orchestra has fallen silent 

254 



** The execution of the guilty is unpleasant — but not nearly so dis- 
turbing as the slaughter of the innocents If you are out for my blood, 
won’t >ou allow me to hana you a more serviceable weapon ^ ” 

He glanced round and, finding that everybody but Miss Pyke and 
themselves was sitting down sJent, made a brief, interrogative pause, 
which looked lixe politeness, but which Harriet mentally classed as 
“ good theatre ” 

Miss P>4e led the way to a large sofa near IMiss Hilly ard’s vVindow-seat 
and said, as she settled herself m the corner of it 
“ Do you mean the murderer’s victims ^ ” 

No,” said Peter, “ I meant my own victims ” 

He sat down between Miss Pyke and Miss Barton, and went on in a 
pleasantly conversational tone 

“For example , 1 happened to find out that a young woman had 
murdered an old one for her money It didn’t matter mucn the old 
woman was dying in any case, and the girl (though she didn’t know that) 
would have inherited the money in any case As soon as I started to 
meddle, the girl set to work again, killed two innocent people to cover 
her tracks and murderously attacked three others Finally she killed 
herself If I d left her alone, there might have been only one death 
instead of four ” 

“ Good gracious * ” said Miss Pyke “ But the woman would have been 
at large ” 

“ Oh, yes She wasn’t a mce woman, and she had a nasty influence on 
certain people But who killed those other two innocents — she or 
society ^ ” 

“ They were killed,” said Miss Barton, “ by her fear of the death- 
penalty If the unfortunate woman had been medically treated, they 
and she would still be ahve to-day ” 

“ I told you It was a good weapon But it isn’t as simple as all that If 
she hadn’t killed those others, we should probably never have caught 
her, and so far from being medically treated she would be hving in 
prosperity — and incidentally comipting one or two people’s minds, if 
you think that of any importance ” 

“ You are suggesting, I think,” said the Warden, while Miss Barton 
rebelliously grappled with this problem, “ that those innocent victims 
died for the people , sacnficed to a social principle,” 

“ At any rate, to your social pnnciples,” said Miss Barton*’ 

“ Thank you I thought you were going to say, to my inquisitive- 
ness ” 

“ I might have done so,” said Miss Barton, frankly “ But you lay 
claim to a prmaple, so we’ll stick to that ” 

“ Who were the other three people attacked ^ ” asked Harriet (She 
had no fancy to let Miss Barton get away with it too easily ) 

“ A lawyer, a colleague of mine and myself But that doesn’t prove 

«55 



that I have any principles Fm quite capable of getting killed for the fun 
of the thing Who isn’t ? 

“ I know,” said the Dean “ It’s funny that we get so solemn about 
murders and executions and nund so little about taking risks in motoring 
and swimming and climbing mountains and so on I suppose we do prefer 
to die for the fun of the tiung ” 

“ The social pnnciple seems to be,” suggested Miss Pyke, that we 
should die for our own fun and not other people’s ” 

“ Of course I admit,” said Miss Barton, rather angiily, that murder 
must be prevented and murderers kept from doing further harm But 
they ought not to be punished and they certainly ought not to be killed ” 
** I suppose they ought to be kept in hospitals at vast expense, along 
with other unfit specimens,” said Miss Edwards ‘‘ Speaking as a biolo- 
gist, I must say I think pubhc money might be better employed What 
with the number of imbeciles and phy^^ical wrecks we allow to go about 
and propagate their species, we shall end by devitalising whole nations ” 
“ Miss Schuster-Slatt would advocate sterilisation,” said the Dean 
“ They’re trying it in Germany, I believe,” said Miss Edwards 
“ Together,” said Miss HiUyard, “ with the relegation of woman to her 
proper place in the home ” 

“ But they execute people there quite a dot,” said Wimsey, “ so Miss 
Barton can’t take over their organisation lock, stock and barrel ” 

Miss Barton uttered a loud protest against any such suggestion, and 
returned to her contention that her social pnnciples were opposed to 
violence of every description 

“ Bosh ’ ” said Miss Edwards ** You can’t carry through any principle 
without doing violence to somebody Either directly or indirectly Every 
time you disturb the balance of nature you let m violence And if you 
leave nature alone you get violence in any case I quite agree that mur- 
derers shouldn’t be hhnged — ^it’s wasteful and unkmd But I don’t agree 
that they should be comfortably fed and housed while decent people go 
short Economically speaking, they should be used for laboiatory 
experiments.” 

“ To assist the further preservation of the unfit ^ ” asked Wimsey, 
dniy 

“ To assist in establishing scientific facts,” rephed Miss Edwards, more 
dnly still 

“ Shake hands,” said Wimsey “ Now we have found common ground 
to stand on Establish the facts, no matter what comes of it ” 

On that ground. Lord Peter,” said the Warden, ” your inquisitive- 
ness becomes a pnnciple And a very dangerous one ” 

“ But the fact that A killed B isn’t necessanl> the whole of the truth,” 
persisted Miss Barton A’s provocation and state of health are facts, 
too” 

** Nobody surely disputes that,” said Miss Pyke “ But one can scarcely 



ask the investigator to go beyond his job If we mayn’t establish any 
conclusion for fear somebody should make an injudicious use of it, we 
are back in the days of Galileo There would be an end to discovery ” 

“ Weil,” said the Dean “ I wish w^e could stop disco\ering things like 
poison-gas ” 

“ There can be no objection to tne making of discoveries,” said Miss 
Hilly ard , “ but is it always expedient to publish them ^ In the case of 
Galileo, the Church ” 

‘‘ You’ll never get any scientist to agree there,” broke m Miss Edwards 
“ To suppress a fact is to publish a falsenood ” 

For a few^ minutes Hamet lost the thread of the discussion, w^hich now 
became general* That it had been deliberately pushed to this point, she 
could see , but what Peter wanted to make of it, she had no idea Yet he 
was obviously interested His eyes, under their half-closed lids, were alert 
He was like a cat w^aiting at a mouse-hole Or was she half-consciously 
connecting him with his own blazon ^ “ Sable three mice courant 
argent , a crescent for difference The crest, a domestick catt ” 

“ Of course,” said Miss Hillyard, in a hard, sarcastic voice, if you 
think private loyalties should come before loyalty to one’s job 

(“ Couched as to spring, proper ”) That w-as what he had been waitmg 
for, then One could almost see the silken fur npple 
** Of course, I don’t say that one should be disloyal to one’s job for 
private reasons,” said Miss Lydgate ** But surely, if one takes on personal 
responsibihties, one owes a duty m that direction If one’s job interferes 
with them, perhaps one should give up the job ” 

** I quite agree,” said Miss Hillyard But then, my private responsi- 
bilities are few, and possibly I have no ngnt to speak What xs your 
opmion, Mrs Goodwin ^ ” 

There was a most unpleasant pause 

“ If you mean that personally,” said the Secretary, getting up and 
facing the Tutor, “ I am so far of your opmion that I have ask^ Dr 
Baring to accept my resignation Not because of any of the monstrous 
allegations that have been made about me, but because I realise that 
under the circumstances I can’t do my work as well as I ought But you 
are all very much mistaken if you think I am at the bottom of the trouble 
in this college I’m going now, and you can say w'hat you like about me 
— but may I say that anybody with a passion for facts will do better to 
collect them from unprejudiced sources Miss Barton at least will adimt 
tiiat mental health is a fact like another ” 

Into the horrified silence that followed, Peter dropped three words 
like lumps of ice 
“ Please don’t go ” 

Mrs Goodwin stopped short w'lth her hand on the door 
“ It would be a great pity,” said the Warden, “ to take anything 
personally that is said in a general discussion I feel sure Mbss Hillyard 
G N. — 9 ^57 



meant nothing of that kind Naturally, some people have better oppor- 
tunities than others for seeing both sides of a question In your own line 
of work, Lord Peter, such conflicts of loyalty must frequently occur ” 
Oh, yes I once thought I had the agreeable choice between hanging 
either my brother or my sister Fortunately, it came to nothing ” 

“ But supposing it had come to something ^ ” demanded Miss Barton, 
pinning the argumentum ad hominem with a kind of relish 

** Oh, weU— “What does the ideal detective do then, Miss Vane ^ ” 

“ Professional etiquette,’* said Harriet, “ would suggest an extorted 
confession, followed by poison for two in the library ” 

** You see how easy it is, when you stick to the rules,” said Wimsey 
Miss Vane feels no compunction She wipes me out with a firm hand, 
rather than damage my reputation But the question isn’t always so 
simple How about the artist of genius who has to choose between lettmg 
his family starve and painting pot-boilers to keep them ^ ” 

“ He’s no business to have a wife and family,” said Miss Hillyard. 

** Poor devil < Then he has the further interesting choice between 
repressions and immorality Mrs Goodwin, I gather, would object to 
the repressions and some people might object to the immorality ” 

“ That doesn’t matter,” said Miss Pyke “ You have hypothesised a 
wife and family Well — ^he could stop painting That, if he really is a 
gemus, would be a loss to the world But he mustn’t paint bad pictures — 
that would be really immoral ” 

“ Why ^ ” asked Miss Edwards “ What do a few bad pictures matter, 
more or less ^ ” 

“ Of course they matter,” said Miss Shaw She knew a good deal about 
pamting A bad picture by a good pamter is a betrayal of truth — ^his 
own truth ” 

That’s only a relative kind of truth,” objected Miss Edwards 
The Dean and Miss Burrows fell headlong upon this remark, and 
Harriet, seeing the argument m danger of getting out of hand, thought 
It time to retrieve the bail and send it back She knew now what was 
wanted, though not why it was wanted 
** If you can’t agree about pamters, make it someone else Make it a 
scientist ” 

** I’ve no objection to scientific pot-boilers,” said !Miss Edwards “ I 
mean, a popular book isn’t necessarily unscientific ” 

“ So long,” said Wimsey, “ as it doesn’t falsify the facts But it might 
be a different kmd of thing To take a concrete instance — somebody 

wrote a novel called The Search ” 

** C P Snow,” said Miss Burrows ” It’s funny you should mention 

that It was the book that the ” 

** I know,” said Peter “ That’s possibly why it was m my mind.” 

“ I never read the book,” said the Warden 

** Oh, I did,” said the Dean “ It’s about a man who starts out to be a 
258 



scientist and gets on very well till, just as he’s going to be appointed to an 
important executive post, he finds he’s made a careless error m a scienti- 
fic paper He didn’t check liis assistant’s results, or something Somebody 
finds out, and he doesn’t get the job So he decides he doesn’t really care 
about science after ail ” 

“ Obviously not,” said Miss Edwards “ He only cared about the post ” 

“ But,” said Miss Chilpenc, “ if it was only a mistake ” 

“ The point about it,” said Wimsey, is what an elderly scientist says 
to him He tells him ‘ The only ethical principle which has made 
science possible is that the tiuth shall be told all the <^inie If we do not 
penalise false statements made in error, we open up the way for false 
statements by intention And a false statement of fact, made delibeiately, 
IS the most serious cnme a scientist can commit ’ Words to that effect 
I may not be quoting quite correctly ” 

“ Well, that’s true, of course Nothing could possibly excuse deliberate 
falsification ” 

“ There’s no sense in deliberate falsification, anyhow,” said the 
Bursar “ What could anybody gam by it ^ ” 

“ It has been done,” said Miss Hillyard, “ frequently To get the 
better of an argument Or out of ambition ” 

“ Ambition to be what ^ ” cried Miss Lydgate ** What satisfaction 
could one possibly get out of a reputation one knew one didn’t deserve ^ 
It would be horrible ” 

Her innocent indignation upset everybody’s gravity 
“ How about the Forged Decretals Chatterton Ossian 
Henry Ireland those Nineteenth-Century Pamphlets the 
other day ^ ” 

“ I know,” said Miss Lydgate, perplexed ” I know people do it. But 
why ^ They must be mad ” 

“ In the same novel,” said the Dean, “ somebody dehberately falsifies 
a result — Plater on, I mean — in order to get a job And the man who made 
the original mistake finds it out But he says nothing, because the other 
man is very badly off and has a wnfe and family to keep ” 

“ These wives and families * ” said Peter 
“ Does the author approve ^ ” inqmred the Warden 
** Well,” said the Dean, “ the book ends there, so I suppose he does ” 
** But does anybody here approve ^ A false statement is published and 
the man who could correct it lets it go, out of chantable considerations 
Would anybody here do that ^ There’s your test case, Miss Barton, with 
no personalities attached ” 

“ Of course one couldn’t do that,” said Miss Barton. Not for ten 
wives and fifty children.” 

** Not for Solomon and all his wives and concubines ^ I congratulate 
you, Miss Barton, on striking such a fine, unfeminine note. WiE nobody 
say a word for the women and childr^ ’ ”

(“ I knew he was going to be mischievoiiSj” thought Harriet*) 

“ You’d like to hear it, wouldn’t you ^ ” said Miss Hillyard 
You’ve got us m a cleft stick,” said the Dean ‘‘ If we say it, you can 
point out that womanliness unfits us for learning , and if we don’t, you 
can point out that learning makes us unwomanly ” 

‘‘ Since I can make myself offensive either way,” said Wimsey, ** you 
have nothing to gain by not telling the truth ” 

“ The truth is,” said Mrs Goodwin, “ that nobody could possibly 
defend the indefensible ” 

“ It sounds, anyway, like a manufactured case,” said Miss Allison, 

briskly “ It could very seldom happen , and if it did ” 

“ Oh, It happens,” said Miss de Vine It has happened It happened 
to me I don’t mind telling you — ^without names, of course When I was 
at Flamborough College examimng for the professorial theses in York 
Umversity, theie was a man who sent in a very interesting paper on a 
historical subject It was a most persuasive piece of argument , only I 
happened to know that the whole contention was quite untrue, because 
a letter that absolutely contradicted it was actually m existence in a 
certain very obscure library in a foreign town I’d come across it when 
I was reading up something else That wouldn’t have mattered, of course 
But the internal evidence showed that the man must have had access to 
that library So I had to make an inquiry, and I found that he really 
had been there and must have seen the letter and deliberately sup- 
pressed It ” 

‘‘ But how could you be so sure he had seen the letter ” asked Miss 
Lydgate anxiously “ He might carelessly have overlooked it That 
would be a very different matter ” 

“ He not only had seen it,” replied Miss de Vine , “ he stole it We 
made him adnait as much He had come upon that letter when his thesis 
was nearly complete, and he had no time to rewrite it And it was a great 
blow to him apart from that, because he had grown enamoured of his 
own theory and couldn’t bear to give it up ” 

“ That’s the mark of an unsound scholar, I’m afraid,” said Miss 
Lydgate in a mournful tone, as one speaks of an incurable cancer 
“ But here is the curious thing,” went on Miss de Vine ** He was 
unscrupulous enough to let the false conclusion stand , but he was too 
good a histonan to destroy the letter He kept it ” 

“ You’d think,” said Miss Pyke, “ it would be as painful as biting on a 
sore tooth ” 

Perhaps he had some idea of rediscovering it some day,” said Miss de 
Vme, and setting himself right with his conscience I don’t know, and 
I don’t think he knew very well himself ” 

“ What happened to him ^ ” asked Harriet 
Well, that was the end of him, of course He lost the professorship, 
naturally, and they took away his M A degree as well A pity, because 
u&o 



he was brilliant in his own way — and very good-loolang, if that has 
anytlung to do with it ” 

“ Poor man * said Miss Lydgate ** He must have needed the post 
very badly ” 

“ It meant a good deal to him financially He was married and not well 
off I don*t know what became of him That was aboht six years ago He 
dropped out completely One was sorry about it, but there it was ** 

“ You couldn’t possibly have done anything else,” said Miss Edw^’ards 
“ Of course not A man as undependable as that is not only useless, 
but dangerous He might do anything ” 

“ You’d think it would be a lesson to him,” said Ivliss Hillyard “ It 
didn’t pay, did it^ Say he sacrificed his professional honour for the 
women and children we hear so much about — but in tlie end it left him 
worse off ” 

“ But that,” said Peter, “ was only because he committed the extra sin 
of being found out,” 

“ It seems to me,” began Miss Ghilpenc, timidly— and then stopped 
“ Yes ^ ” said Peter. 

Well,” said Miss Ghilpenc, “ oughtn’t the women and children to 
have a point of view ^ I mean — suppose the wife knew that her husband 
had done a thing like that for her, what would she feel about it ^ ” 

** That’s a very important point,” said Hamet “ You’d think she’d 
feel too ghastly for words ” 

** It depends,” said the Dean, 1 don’t believe mne women out of ten , 
would care a dash ” 

** That’s a monstrous thing to say,” cned Miss Hillyard 
“ You think a wife might feel sensitive about her husband’s honour — 
even if it was sacrificed on her account ^ ” said Miss Stevens “ V^ell — I 
don’t know ” 

“ I should think,” said Miss Ghilpenc, stammermg a little in her 
earnestness, “ she would feel like a man who — I mean, wouldn’t it be 
like living on somebody’s immoral earmngs ^ ” 

“ There,” said Peter, “ if I may say so, I think vou are exaggeratmg. 
The man who does that — if he isn’t too far gone to have any feelings at 
all — ^is hit by other considerations, some of which have nothing whatever 
to do wnth ethics. But it is extremely interesting that you should make 
the comparison ” He looked at Miss Ghilpenc so intently that she 
blushed 

Perhaps that was rather a stupid thing to say ” 

** No But if It ever occurs to people to value the honour of the mind 
equaiUy with the honour of the body, we shall get a soaal revolution of 
a quite unparalleled sort — and very different from the kmd that is being 
made at the moment ” 

Miss Ghilpenc looked so much alarmed at the idea of fostenng 
social revolution that only the opportune ^try of two GoiiGmaon-Room 

261 



scouts to remove the ooffee-cups and relieve her of the necessity 
replying seemed to have saved her from sinking through the floor 

Well,*’ said Harriet, ‘ I agree absolutely with Miss Ghilpenc If 
anybody did a dishonourable thing and then said he did it for one^s own 
sake, It would be the last insult How could one ever feel the same to him 
again ? ” 

Indeed,*’ said Miss Pyke, “ it must surely vitiate the whole 
relationship ” 

“ Oh, nonsense * ” cried the Dean “ How many women care two 
hoots about anybody’s intellectual integrity^ Only over-educated 
women hke us So long as the man didn’t forge a cheque or rob the till 
or do somethmg soaally degrading, most women would think he was 
perfectly justified Ask Mrs Bones the Butcher’s Wife or Miss Tape the 
Tailor’s Daughter how much they would worry about suppressmg a fact 
in a mouldy old historical thesis ” 

“ They’d back up their husbands, in any case,” said Miss Allison “ My 
man, nght or wrong, they’d say Even if he did rob the till ” 

Of course they would,” said Miss HiUyard “ That’s what the man 
wants He wouldn’t say thank you for a critic on the hearth ” 

“ He must have the womanly woman, you think ^ ” said Harriet 
“ What IS It, Anme ^ My coffee-cup ^ Here you are. Somebody 
who will say, ‘ The greater the sin the greater the sacnfice — and con- 
sequently the greater devotion ’ Poor Miss Schuster-Slatt * , , I 

suppose It is comfortmg to be told that one is loved whatever one does ” 
“ Ah, yes,” said Peter, in his reediest wood-wmd voice 

And these say • * No more now my kmght 
Or God’s kmght any longer * — ^you, 

Bemg than they so much more white, 

So much more pure and good and true, 

Will cling to me for ever — 

William Morns had his moments of bemg a himdred-per-cent manly 
man ” 

Poor Morns * ” said the Dean 

He was young at the time,” said Peter, indulgently “ It’s odd, when 
you come to think of it, that the expressions * manly ’ and ‘ womanly ’ 
should be almost more offensive than their opposites One is tempted to 
believe that there may be something mdelicate about sex after ail ” 

It all comes of this here eddication,” pronounced the Dean, as the 
door shut behind the last of the coffee-service Here we sit round in a 
nng, dissociaUng ourselves from bnd Mrs Bones and that sweet girl, 
Miss Tape ” 

Not to mention,” put m Hamet, ** those fine, manly fellows, the 

mascuime Tapes and Boneses ” 

262 



“ And clacking on in the most unwomanly manner about intellectual 
mtegnty ’’ 

While Ij” said Peter, “ sit desolate m the midst, liKe a lodge in a 
garden of cucumbers ” 

“ You look it,” said Harriet, laugiiing “ The sole relic of humamty 
m a cold, bitter and indigestible wilderness ” 

There was a laugh, and a momentary silence Harriet could feel a 
nervous tension in the room — httle threads of anxiety and expectation 
strung out, meeting, crossing, quivering Now, they were all saying to 
themselves, now something is going to be said aboat it The ground has 
been surveyed, the coffee has been cleared out of the road the combat- 
ants are stripped for action — now, this amiable gentleman with the weil- 
fiied tongue will come out in his true colours as an inquisitor, and it is all 
going to be very uncomfortable 

Lord Peter took out his handkerchief, polished his monocle care- 
fully, readjusted it, looked rather severely at the Warden, and lifted up 
his voice in emphatic, pained and querulous complaint about the 
Corporation dump 


The Warden had gone, expiessing courteous thanks to Miss Lydgate 
for the hospitality of the Senior Common Room, and graciously inviting 
his lordship to call upon her in her own house at any convenient time 
during his stay in Oxford Various dons rose up and drifted away, mur- 
muring that they had essays to look through before they went to bed 
The talk had ranged pleasantly over a variety of topics Peter had let 
the reins drop from his hands and let it go whither it would, and Harnet, 
realising this, had scarcely troubled to follow it In the end, there 
remained only herself and Peter, the Dean, Miss Edw^ards (who seemed 
to have taken a strong fancy to Peter’s conversation), Miss Chilpenc, 
silent and half-hidden in an obscure position and, rather to Harrietts 
surpnse, Miss Hillyard 

The clocks struck eleven Wimsey roused himself and said he thought 
he had better be getting along Everybody rose The Old Quad was dark, 
except for the gleam of lighted windows , the sky had clouded, and a 
using wind stirred the boughs of the beechtrees 

Well, good mght,” said Miss Edwards ** I’ll see that you get a copy 
of that paper about blood-groups I think you’ll find it of interest ” 

“ I shall, mdeed,” said Wimsey Thank you very much ” 

Miss Edwards strode briskly away 
“ Good mght, Lord Peter 

“ Good mght, Miss Ghilpenc Let me know when the social revolution 
is about to begin and I’ll come to die upon the barncades ” 

I think you would,” said Miss Chilpenc, astonishingly, and, in 
defiance of tradition, gave him her hand 

263 



Good night,” said Miss Hillyard, to the world m general, and 
whisked quickly past them with her head high 
Miss Chilperic flitted off into the darkness like a pale moth, and the 
Dean said, “ Well • ” And then, interrogatively, “ Well ^ ” 

“ Pass, and all’s well,” said Peter, placidly 

“ There were one or two moments, weren’t there ^ ” said the Dean, 
" But on the whole — as well as could be expected ” 

“ I enjoyed myself very much,” said Petei, with the mischievous note 
back m his voice 

I bet you did,” said the Dean I wouldn’t trust >ou a yaid Not a 
yard ” 

Oh, yes, you would,” said he “ Don’t worry ” 

The Dean, too, was gone 

“ You left your gown in my room yesterday,” said Harriet “ You’d 
better come and fetch it ” 

“ I brought yours back with me and left it at the Jowett Walk Lodge 
Also your dossier I expect they’ve been taken up ” 

“ You didn’t leave the dossier lying about * ” 

“ What do you take me for ^ It’s wrapped up and sealed ” 

They crossoi the quad slowly 
“ There are a lot of questions I want to ask, Peter.” 

“ Oh, yes And there’s one I want to ask you What is your second 
name ^ The one that begins with a D ^ ” 

“ Deborah, I’m sorry to say. Why ’ ” 

** Deborah ^ Well, I’m damned All right I won’t call you by it 
There’s Miss de Vine, I see, still working ” 

The curtains of the Fellow’s window were drawn back this time, and 
they could see her dark, imtidy head, bent over a book 

She interests me very much,” said Peter 
“ I like her, you know ” 

So do I ” 

But I’m afraid those are her kmd of hairpms ” 

“ I know they are,” said he He took his hand from his pocket and 
held it out They were close under Tudor, and the light from an adjacent 
window showed a melancholy, spraddle-legged hairpin lying across his 
palm. ** She shed this on the dais after dmner. You saw me pick it up ” 

“ I saw you pick up Miss Shaw’s scarf” 

“ Always the gentleman May I come up with you, or is that against 
the regulations ’ ” 

" You can come up ” 

There were a number of students scurrying about the comdors in 
undress, who looked at Peter with more cunosity than annoyance* In 
Harriet’s room, they found her gown lying on the table, together with 
the dossier, Peter picked up the book, examined the paper and string and 
264 



the seals which secured them, each one stamped with the crouching cat 
and arrogant Wimsey motto 

“ If that’s been opened, Fll make a meal of hot seaimg-wax ” 

He went to the wmdow and looked out into the quad 
“ Not a bad observation post — in its wa> Thanks That’s all I wanted 
to look at ” 

He showed no fuither curiosity, but took the gown she handed to him 
and followed her downstairs again 
They were half-way across the quad when he said suddenly 
Harriet Do you really prize honesty abo\e every other thing ^ ” 

“ I think I do I hope so Why ^ ” 

“ If you don’t, I am the most blazing fool m Christendom I am busily 
engaged in sawing off my own branch If I am honest, I shall probably 

lose you altogether If I am not ” 

His voice was cunously rough, as though he w^ere trying to control 
something , not, she thought, bodily pain or passion, but sometlung more 
fundamental 

** If you are not,” said Harriet, “ then I shall lose }ou^ because you 
wouldn’t be the same person, would you ” 

“ I don’t know I have a reputation for fhppant insmccnty. You 
think I’m honest ^ ” 

“ I know you are I couldn’t imagine your bemg anything else ” 

“ And yet at this moment I’m trymg to insure myself against the 
effects of my own honesty * I have tried if I could reach Uiat great resolu- 
tion, to be honest without a thought of heaven or hell ’ It looks as though 
I should get hell either way, though , so I need scarcely bother about the 
resolution I believe you mean what you say — and I hope I should do 
the same thing if I didn’t beheve a word of it ” 

“ Peter, I haven’t an idea what you’re talkmg about.” 

“ All the better Don’t worry I won’t behave like this another time* 

* The Duke drained a dipper of brandy-and-water and became again 
the perfect English gentleman * Give me your hand ” 

She gave it to him, and he held it for a moment m a firm clasp, and 
then drew her arm through his They moved on into the New Quad, arm 
in arm, m silence As they passed the archway at the foot of the Hall 
stairs, Harriet fanaed she heard somebody stir m the darkness and saw 
the faint glimmer of a watching face , but it was gone before she could 
draw Peter’s attention to it 

Padgett unlocked the gate for them , Wimsey, stepping pre-occupied 
over the threshold, tossed him a heedless good mght 
“ Good night, Major Wimsey, sir * ” 

‘‘ Hullo * ” Peter brought back the foot that was already m St Cross 
Road, and looked closely mto the porter’s smiling face 
** My god, yes ^ Stop a mmutc. Don’t tell me Gaudry — 1918 I’ve 
got it • Padgett’s the name Corporal Padgett ” 

9* 



“ Quite right, sir 

“ Well, well, well I’m damned glad to see you Looking dashed fit, 
too How are you keeping 

“ Fine, thank you, sir ” Padgett’s large and hairy paw closed warmly 
over Peter’s long fingers “ I says to my wife, when I ’eard you was ’ere, 
I’ll lay you anything you like,’ I says, ‘ the Major won’t have 
forgotten ’ ” 

“ By jove, no Fancy finding you here * Last time I saw you, I was 
being carried away on a stretcher ” 

That’s right, sir I ’ad the pleasure of ’elping to dig you out ” 

** I know you did I’m glad to see you now, but I was a dashed sight 
gladder to see you then ’’ 

“ Yes, sir Gorblimey, sir — ^well, there * We thought you was gone 
that time I says to Hackett — ^remember httle Hackett, sir ^ ” 

“ The little red-headed bhghter ^ Yes, of course What’s become of 
him ^ ” 

“ Dnvmg a lorry over at Reading, sir, married and three kids I says 
to Hackett, ‘ Lor’ lumme * ’ I says, ‘ there’s old Winderpane gawn — 
excuse me, sir — and he says, ‘ ’Ell * wot ruddy luck ! ’ So I says, ‘ Don’t 

stand there gnzzlin* — maybe *e am’t gawn after all ’ So we ” 

“ No,” said Wimsey I fancy I was more fnghtened than hurt Un- 
pleasant sensation, being buned ahve ” 

“ Well, sir * W’en we finds yer there at the bottom o’ that there old 
Boche dug-out with a big beam acrost yer, I says to Hackett, * Well,’ I 
says, ‘ *e’s all ’ere, anyhow ’ And he says, * Thank gawd for Jerry * ’ ’e 

says — ^meanm’, if it ’adn’t been for that there dug-out ” 

” Yes,” said Wimsey, “ I had a bit of luck there We lost poor Mr 
Danbury, though ” 

“ Yes, sir Bad thing, that was A mce young gentleman. Ever see 
anything of Captain Sidgwick nowadays, sir ^ ” 

“ Oh, yes I saw him only the other day at the Bellona Club He’s not 
very fit these days, I’m sorry to say Got a dose of gas, you know Lungs 
groggy ” 

” Sorry to hear that, sir Remember how put about *e was over that 
there pig ” 

” Hush, Padgett The less said about that pig, the better ” 

“ Yes, sir Nice bit o’ crackling that pig ’ad on ’im Coo ! ” Padgett 
smacked re minis cent bps. ** You ’card wot ’appened to Sergeant-major 
Toop^” 

** Toop ^ No — I’ve quite lost sight of him Nothing unpleasant, I hope 
Best sergeant-major I ever had ” 

“ Ah * he was a one ” Padgett’s gnn widened ** Well, sir, ’e foimd ’is 
match all nght Little bit of a thing — no ’igher than that, but, lummy * ” 
Go on, Padgett You don’t say so ” 

** Yes, sir. When I was workm’ m the camel *ouse at the Zoo— ” 
366 



“ Good God, Padgett ’ ” 

“ Yes, sir — I see them there and we passed the time o^ day Went 
round to look *em up afterwards Weil, there * She give ’im sergeant- 
major all right Put ’im through the *oop proper You know the old 

song Naggm’ at a feller as is six foot three ’’ 

“ And her only four foot two ^ Well, well * How are the mighty fallen * 
By the bye, Fll tell you who I ran into the other day — now, this will 
surprise you 

The stream of reminiscence ran remorselessly on, till Wimsey, suddenly 
reminded of his manners, apologised to Harriet and plunged hastily out, 
with a promise to return for another chat over old times Padgett, still 
beaming, swimg the heavy gate to, and locked it 
“Ah’” said Padgett, “ he ain’t changed much, the major ’asn’t He 
was a lot younger then, o’ course — only just gazetted — but he was a 
regular good officer for all that — and a terror for eye-w^ash And shavm’ 
— ^lumme ’ ” 

Padgett, supporting himself with one hand against the brickwork of 
the lodge, appeared lost in the long ago 

“ * Now, men,’ ’e’d say, when we was expectin’ a bit of a strafe, ‘ if 
you gotter face your Maker, fer Gawd’s sake, face ’Im with a clean chin ’ 
Ah ’ Wmderpane, we called ’im, along of the eyeglass, but meamn’ no 
disrespect None on us wouldn’t ’ear a word agm ’im Now, there was a 
chap came to us from another umt — ’ulkin’ foul-mouthed fellow, wot 
nobody took to much — ’Uggins, that was the name, ’Uggins Weil, this 
bloke thinks ’e’s gom’ to be funny, see — and *e starts callin’ the major 

Little Percy, and usm’ opprobnous epithets ” 

Here Padgett paused, to select an epithet fit for a lady’s ear, but, 
faihng, repeated, 

“ Opprobnous epithets, miss And I says to ’im — ^mind you, this was 
afore I got my stripes , I was jes a pnvate then, same as ’Uggins — I says 
to ’im, ‘ Now, that’s quite enough o’ that ’ And ’e says to me — ^Well, 
anyway, the end of it was, we ’ad a lovely scrap, all round the ’ouses ” 

“ Dear me,” said Hamet 

“ Yes, miss We was in rest at the time, and next mormng, when the 
sergeant-major falls us in for parade — coo, lummy ’ we was a pair o’ 
family portraits. The sergeant-major — Sergeant-major Toop, that was, 
’im wot got mamed hke I was sayin’ — ^*e didn’t say nothin* — ’e knew 
And the adjutant, ’c knew too, and *e didn’t say nothin’ neither. And 
blest if, in the middle of it all, we don’t see the Major comm’ strollin’ out 
So the adjutant forms us up into line, and I stands there at attention, 
’oping as ’Uggins’s face looked worse nor what mine did ‘ Mormng,’ says 
the Major , and the adjutant and Sergeant-major Toop says, ‘ Mormng, 
sir ’ So ’e starts to chat casual-like to the sergeant-major, and I see *is 
eye gom’ up and down the hne * Sergeant-major ’ ’ says he, all of a 
sudden * Sat ’ * says the sergeant-major * What’s that man there b^n 



doin’ to ’imself ^ ’ says ’e, meamn’ me * Sir ^ ’ says the sergeant-major, 
starin’ at me like ’e was surprised to see me ^ Looks as if he’d had a 
nasty accident,’ savs the Major * And what about that other fellow ^ 
Don’t like to see that sort of thing Not smart Fall ’em out ’ So the 
sergeant-major falls us both out ‘ H’m * says the Major ‘ I see What’s 
this man’s name ^ ’ * Padgett, sir,’ says the sergeant-major ‘ Oh,’ says 
he ‘ Weil, Padgett, what have you been doing to get yourself into a mess 
like that ’ * Fell over a bucket, sir,’ says I, stann’ ’ard over ’is shoulder 
with the onlv eye I could see out of ‘ Bucket ^ * says ’e, * very awkward 
things, buckets And this other man — I suppose he trod on the mop, eh, 
sergeant-major ^ ’ * Major wants to know if you trod on the mop,’ says 
Sergeant-major Toop ‘ Yessir,’ says ’Uggins, talkin’ like ’is mouth ’urt 
’im ‘ Weil,’ says the Major, * when you’ve got this lot dismissed, give 
these two men a bucket and a mop a-piece and put ’em on fatigue 
That’ll learn ’em to ’andle these dangerous implements ’ ‘ Yessir,’ says 
Sergeant-major Toop ‘ Garry on,* says the Major So we carries on 
’Uggins says to me arterwards ‘ D’you think *e knew * ’ * Knew ^ ’ says 
I, ‘ course ’e knew Ain’t much *e don’t know * Arter that, ’Uggins kep’ 
’is epithets to ’isself ” 

Harriet expressed due appreciation of this anecdote, which was de- 
hvered with a great deal of gusto, and took leave of Padgett For some 
reason, this affair of a mop and a bucket seemed to have made Padgett 
Peter’s slave for life Men were very odd 

There was nobo dy under the Hall arches as she returned, but as she 
passed the West end of the Chapel, she thought she saw something dark 
pass like a shadow into the Fellows’ Garden She followed it Her eyes 
were growing accustomed to the dimness of the summer mght and she 
could see the figure walking swiftly up and down up and down, and hear 
the rustle of its long skirt upon the grass 

There was only one person in College who had worn a trailing frock 
that evening, and that was Miss Hillyard She walked in the Fellows’ 
Garden for an hour and a half 


CHAPTER XVIII 

Go tell that witty fellow, my godson, to get home It is no season 
to fool It here * 

QPEEN ELIZABETH 


** Lor’ * ” said the Dean 

She gazed with interest from the Senior Common Room window, 
teacup m hand 



“ What’s the matter ^ *’ inquired Miss Allison 
“ Who IS this incredibly beautiful young man ^ ” 

“ Flaxman’s fiance, I expect, isn’t it ^ ” 

“ A beautiful young man ^ ” said Miss Pyke “ I should like to see 
him ” She moved to the window 

“ Don’t be ridiculous,” said the Dean I knovv Fiaxman’s Byron by 
heart This is an ash-blond in a House blazer ” 

“ Oh, dear me * ” said Miss Pyke Apollo Belvedere m spotless 
flannels He appears to be unattached Remarkable ” 

Harriet put down her cup and rose from the depths of the largest 
armchair 

“ Perhaps he belongs to that bunch pla>mg tennis,” hazarded Miss 
Allison 

“ Little Cooke’s scrubby friends ^ My dear > ” 

“Why all the excitement, anyway ^ ” asked kliss Hillyard 
“ Beautiful young men are alwa>ns exciting,” said the Dean 
“ That,” said Harriet, at length gelling a glimpse of the wonder- 
youth over Miss Pyke’s shoulder “ is Viscount Samt-George ” 

“ Another of your aristocratic friends ^ ” asLea Miss Baiton 
“ His nephew,” replied Harriet , not very coherently 
“ Oh * ” said Miss Barton “ Well, I don’t see why you need all gape 
at him like a lot of school-guis ” 

She crossed over to the table, cut herself a slice of cake and glanced 
casually out of the farther wmdow 

Lord Samt-George stood, with a careless air of ownmg the place, at 
the corner of the Library Wing, watchmg a game of tennis being played 
between two bare-backed students and two young men whose shirts 
kept on escaping from their belts Growmg tired of this, he sauntered 
past the wmdows towards Queen Elizabeth, his eye roinng over a group 
of Shrewsbunans a-sprawl under the beeches, like that of a young 
Sultan inspecting a rather unpromismg consignment of Circassian 
slaves 

“ Supercihous little beast ’ ” thought Harnet , and wondered if he 
was looking for her If he was, he could wait, or ask properly at the 
Lodge 

“ Oho ^ ” said the Dean “ So ikat^s how the milk got into the coco- 
nut I ” 

From the door of the Library Wing there issued slowly Miss de Vine, 
and behind her, grave and deferential, Lord Peter Wimsey They 
skirted the tenms court in earnest conversation Lord Samt-George, 
viewing them from afar, advanced to meet them They joined forces on 
the path They stood for a httle time talking They moved aw av towards 
the Lodge 

“ Dear me * ” said the Dean, “ Abduction of Helen de Vine by Pans 
and Hector ” 



“ No, no,” said Miss Pyke ‘ Pans was the brother of Hector, not his 
nephew I do not think he had any uncles ” 

“ Talking of uncles,” said the Dean, “ is it true. Miss Hillyard, that 
Richard III — I thought she was here ” 

“ She was here,” said Harnet 

“ Helen is being returned to us,” said the Dean “ The siege of Troy 
IS postponed ” 

The tno were returning again up the path Half-way along Miss de 
Vine took leave of the two men and returned towards her own room 
At that moment, the watchers in the S C.R were petnfied to behold 
a portent Miss Hillyard emerged from the foot of the Hall stair, bore 
down upon the uncle and nephew, addressed them, cut Lord Peter 
neatly off from his convoy and towed him firmly away towards the New 
Qpad 

“ Glory alleluia ’ ” said the Dean “ Hadn’t you better go out and 
rescue your young friend ^ He’s been deserted again ” 

“ You could offer him a cup of tea,” suggested Miss Pyke “ It would 
be an agreeable diversion for us ” 

** I’m surprised at you, Miss Pyke,” said Miss Barton “ No man is 
safe from women like you ” 

** Now, where have I heard that sentiment before ^ ” said the Dean 
” In one of the Poison-letters,” said Harriet 

“ If you’re suggesting ” began Miss Barton 

“ Pm only suggesting,” said the Dean, “ that it’s a bit of a cliche ” 

** I meant it for a joke,” retorted Miss Barton, angrily “ Some people 
have no sense of humour ” 

She went out and slammed the door Lord Saint-Georgc had wandered 
back and was sittmg m the loggia leading up to the Library He rose 
pohtely as Miss Barton stalked past him on the way to her room, and 
made some remark, to which the Fellow replied briefly, but with a smile 
“ Insinuating men, these Wimseys,” said the Dean Vamping the 
SCR right and left ” 

Harnet laughed, but in Samt-George’s quick, appraising glance at 
Miss Barton she had again seen his uncle look for a moment out of his 
eyes These family resemblances were unnervmg She curled herself into 
the window-seat and watched for nearly ten imnutes The viscount sat 
still, smoking a cigarette, and looking entirely at his ease Miss Lydgate, 
Miss Burrows and Miss Shaw came in and began to pour out tea The 
tennis-party finished the set and moved away Then, from the left, came 
a quick, light step along the gravel walk 
** Hullo • ” said Harriet to the owner of the step. 

Hullo * ” said Peter ** Fancy secmg you here * ” He grinned 
** Come and talk to Gerald He’s m the loggia ” 

I see him qmte plainly,” said Harnet “ His profile has been much 
admired 
^70 



** As a good adopted aunt, why didn*t you go and be kind to the poor 
lad^” 

** I never was one to interfere I keep myself io myself ” 

“ Weil, come now ” 

Harriet got down from the window-seat and joined Wimsey outside 
“ I brought him here,’* said Peter, “ to see if he could make any 
identifications But he doesn’t seem able to ” 

Lord Saint-George greeted Harriet enthusiastically 
“ There was another female went past me,” he said, turmng to Peter 
“ Grey hair badly bobbed Earnest manner Dressed in sack-cloth. 
Institutional touch about her I got speech of her ” 

Miss Barton,” said Harriet 

“ Right sort of eyes , wrong sort of voice I don’t thmk it’s her It 
might be the one that collared you, Uncle She had a Lind of a lean and 
hungry look ” 

“ H’m ’ ” said Peter “ How about the first one ^ ” 

“ I’d like to see her without her glasses ” 

If you mean Miss de Vine,” said Harnet, ” I doubt whether she 
could see very far without them ” 

“ That’s a point,” said Peter, thoughtfully 

“ I’m sorry to be so vague and all that,” said Lord Saint-Gcorge 
“ But it’s not easy to identify a hoarse whisper and a pair of eyes seen 
once by moonlight ” 

No,” said Peter, “ it needs a good deal of practice ” 

“ Practice be blowed,” retorted his nephew ** I’m not going to make 
a practice of it ” 

“ It’s not a bad sport,” said Peter “ You nought take it up till you can 
start games again ” 

” How’s the shoulder getting on ^ ” inquired Harnet 
” Oh, not too bad, thanks The massage bloke is workmg wonders 
with it I can lift the old arm shoulder-high now It’s quite serviceable — 
for some things ” 

By way of demonstration he threw the damaged arm round Hamct’s 
shoulders, and kissed her rapidly and expertly before she could dodge 
him 

** Children, children * ” cned his imcle, plaintively, ” remember 
where you are ” 

“ It’s all nght for md,” said Lord Samt-George ** Pm an adopted 
nephew. Isn’t that nght, Aunt Harriet ^ ” 

“ Not bang underneath the windows of the SCR,’* said Harnet 
” Gome round the corner, then,” said the viscount, impemtently, 
” and I’ll do it again As Uncle Peter says, these things need a good deal 
of practice.” 

He was impudently set upon tormenting his uncle, and Harnet felt 
extremely angry with him. However, to show annoyance to play mto 



his hands She smiled upon him pityingly and uttered the Brasenose 
porter’s classic rebuke 

“ It’s no good you making a noise, gentlemen The Dean ain’t a-coming 
down to-night ” 

This actually silenced him for the moment She turned to Peter, who 
said 

“ Have you any commissions in Town ^ ” 

** V\^y, are you going back ^ ” 

“ I’m runmng up to-mght and on to York in the morning I expect to 
get back on Thursday ” 

« York ? ” 

“ Yes , I want to see a man there — about a dog, and all that ” 

“ Oh, I see Well — if it wouldn’t be out of your way to call at my fiat, 
you might take up a few chapters of manuscript to my secretary I’d 
rather trust you than the post Could you manage it ^ ” 

“ With very great pleasure,” said Wimsey, formally. 

She ran up to her room to get the papers, and from the window 
observed that the Wimsey family was having the matter out with itself 
When she came down with the parcel she found the nephew waiting at 
the door of Tudor, rather red in the face. 

** Please, I am to apologise ” 

“ I should think so,” said Hamet, severely ” I can’t be disgraced like 
this m my own quad Frankly, I can’t afford it ” 

I’m most frightfully sorry,” said Lord Samt-George “ It was rotten 
of me Honestly, I wasn’t thinking of anything except getting Uncle 
Peter’s goat And if it’s any satisfaction to you,” he added, ruefully, “ I 
got It ” 

** Well, be decent to him , he’s very decent to you ” 

** I will be good,” said Peter’s nephew, taking the parcel from her, 
and they proceeded amicably together till Peter rejoined them at the 
Lodge 

“ Damn that boy * ” said Wimsey, when he had sent Samt-George 
ahead to start up the car 

“ Oh, Peter don’t worry about every httle thmg so dreadfully What 
does it matter ? He only wanted to tease you ” 

” It’s a pity he can’t find some other way to do it I seem to be a per- 
fect miil-stonc tied roxmd your neck, and the sooner I clear out the 
better.” 

“ Oh, for goodness’ sake » ” said Hamet, imtated If you’re going 
to be morbid about it, it certainly would be better for you if you did clear 
out. I’ve told you so before ” 

Lord Samt-George, hndmg his elders dilatory, blew a cheerful ** hi- 
tiddley-hi-ti, pom, pom ” on the horn 
** Damn and blast * ” said Peter He took gate and path at a bound, 
pushed his nephew angnly out of the dnving-seat, jerked the door of the 
272 



Daimler to noisily and shot oSf up the road with a bellowing roar Harnetj 
finding herself unexpectedly possessed of a magnificent fit of bad temper, 
went back, determined to extract the last ounce of enjoyment out of it , 
an exercise in which she w^as greatly helped bv the discovery that the 
little episode on the loggia bad greatly intiigued the Senior Common 
Room, and by learning from Miss Allison, after Hall, that Miss Hiiiyard, 
when she heard of it, had made some very unpleasant observations 
which It was only right that Miss Vane shomd know^ about 


Oh, God 5 thought Harriet, alone in her room, what ha\ e I done, more 
chan thousands of other people, except have the rotten luck to be tried 
for my life and have the whole miserable business dragged out into day- 
light ^ Anybody w’^ouid think Fd been punished enough 
But nobody can forget it for a moment I can’t forget it 

Peter can’t forget it If Peter w^asn’t a fool he’d chuck it 

He must see how hopeless it all is Does he thirk I like to see him 
suffering vicanous agonies ^ Does he really suppose I coaid ever 
marry him for the pleasure of seeing him suffer agonies ^ Can’t he 
see that the only thing for me to do is to keep out of it all ^ What 

the devil possessed me to bring him to Oxford ^ Yes — and I thought 
it would be so nice to retire to Oxford to ha\e ** unpleasant obser- 
vations ” made about me by Miss Hillyard, who’s half potty, if >ou ask 
me Somebody’s potty, anyhow that seems to be what 
happens to one if one keeps out of the wa> of love and marriage and ail 
the rest of the muddle Well if Peter fanaes I’m going to “ accept 
the protection of his name ” and be giateful, he’s damn well mistaken 
A mce, miserable business that’d be for him It’s a mce, 
muserable business for him, too, if he really wants me — if he does — and 
can’t have what he wants because I had the rotten luck to be tried for a 
murder I didn’t do It looks as if he was going to get hell either 
way Well, let him get hell, it’s his look-out It’s a pity he 
saved me from bemg hanged — he probably wushes by now he’d left me 
alone I suppose any decently grateful person would gi\e him 

what he wants But it woiddn’t be much gratitude to make him 
miserable We should both be perfectly miserable, because neither 
of us could ever forget I very nearly did forget the other day on 

the river And I had forgotten this afternoon, only he remembered 

It first Damn that impudent little beast ^ how hornbly cruel the 

young can be to the middle-aged * I wasn’t frightfully kind myself 
And I did know what I was doing It’s a good thing Peter’s 
gone but I wish he hadn’t gone and left me m this ghastly place 
where people go off their heads and write homble letters When 

I am from him I am dead till I be wuth him ” No, it won’t do to 
feel like that I won’t get mixed up wuth that kind of thing again 

273 



m stay out of it« , 1*11 stay here where people go queer 
m their heads Oh, God, what have I done, that I should be such 
a misery to myself and other people ^ Nothmg more than thousands of 
women 

Round and round, like a squirrel in a cage, till at last Harriet had to 
say firmly to herself This won’t do, or I shall go potty myself I’d better 
keep my mind on the job What’s taken Peter to York ^ Miss de Vine ^ If 
I hadn’t lost my temper I nught have found out, instead of wasting time 
in quarrelling I wonder if he’s made any notes on the dossier 
She took up the loose-leaf book, which was still wrapped in its paper 
and stnng and sealed all over with the Wimsey crest As my Whimsy 
takes me ” — Peter’s whimsies had taken him into a certain amount of 
trouble She broke the seals impatiently , but the result was disappoint- 
ing He had marked nothing — presumably he had copied out anything 
he wanted She turned the pages, trying to piece some sort of solution 
together, but too tired to think coherently And then — ^yes , here was his 
writmg, 5ure enough, but not on a page of the dossier This was the 
unfinished sonnet — and of all the idiotic things to do, to leave half- 
fimshed sonnets mixed up with one’s detective work for other people to 
see ’ A schoolgirl trick, enough to make anybody blush Particularly 
since, from what she remembered of the sonnet, its sentiments had 
become remarkably inappropriate to the state of her feelings 
But here it was and in the mterval it had taken to itself a sestet and 
stood, looking a little unbalanced, with her own sprawling hand above 
and Peter’s deceptively neat script below, like a large top on a small 
spmdle 

Here then at home, by no mor6 storms distrest, 

Folding labonous hands we sit, wings furled , 

Here in close perfume lies the rose-leaf curled. 

Here the sun stands and knows not east nor west, 

Here no tide runs , we have come, last and best, 

From the wide zone in dizzying circles hurled 
To that still centre where the spmmng world 
Sleeps on its axis, to the heart of rest 

Lay on thy whips, O Love, that we upright, 

Poised on the perilous point, in no lax bed 
May sleep, as tension at the verberant core 
Of music sleeps , for, if thou spare to smite, 

Staggenng, we stoop, stooping, fall dumb and dead. 

And, dymg so, sleep our sweet sleep no more 

Having achieved this, the poet appeared to have lost countenance 
for he had added the comment 

** A very conceited, metaphysical conclusion * ” 



So So there was the turn she had vainly sought for the sestet * Hex 
beautiful, big, peaceful humming-top turned to a wlup-top, and sleep- 
ing, as It were, upon compulsion (And, damn him * how dared he pick 
up her word “ sleep and use it four times m as manv lines, and each 
time m a different foot, as though juggling with the accent-shift were 
child’s play ^ And drag out the last half-line with those great, heavy, 
drugged, drowsy monosyllables, contradicting the sense so as to deny 
their own contradiction ^ It was not one of the woiid’s great sestets, but 
It was considerably better than her own octave which was monstrous of 
It) 

But if she wanted an answ^er to her questions about Peter, there it was, 
quite appallingly plain He did not want to forget, or to be quiet, or to 
be spared things, or to stay put All he wanted was some kind of central 
stability, and he was apparently ready to take anything that came along, 
so long as it stimulated him to keep that precarious balance And of 
course, if he really felt like that, everything he had ever said or done, as 
far as she was concerned, was perfectly consistent ** ^-Iine is only a 
balance of opposing forces ” “ What does it matter if it hurts like 

hell, so long as it makes a good book ^ “ WTiat is the use of 

making mistakes if you don’t make use of tliem ^ “ Feeling like 

Judas is part of the job ” “ The first thing a principle does is to 

kill somebody ” If that was his attitude, it was clearly ridiculous 
to urge him, m kindly tones, to stand aside for fear he might get a rap 
over the shins 

He had tned standing aside “ I have been running away from nayself 
for twenty years, and it doesn’t work ” He no longer believed that the 
Ethiopian could change his skin to rhinoceros hide Even m the five years 
or so that she had known him, Harnet had seen him stop off his pro- 
tections, layer by layer, till there was uncommonly little left but the 
naked truth 

That, then, was what he wanted her for For some reason, obscure to 
herself and probably also to him, she had the power to force him outside 
his defences Perhaps, seemg her struggling m a trap of circumstance, he 
had walked out deliberately to her assistance Or perhaps the sight of 
her struggles had warned him what might happen to him, if he remamed 
in a trap of his own making 

Yet with all this, he seemed wiUing to let her run back behind the 
bamers of the mind, provided — ^yes, he was consistent after all — pro- 
vided she would make her own way of escape through her work He was, 
m fact, offenng her the choice between himself and Wilfrid He did 
recognise that she had an outlet which he had not 

And that, she supposed, was why he was so morbidly sensitive about 
his own part in the comedy His own needs w^ere (as he saw the matter) 
getting between her and her legitimate way of escape They involved her 
m difficulties which he could not share, because she iiad consistently 

275 



refused him the nght to share them He had nothing of his nephew’s 
cheerful readiness to take and have Careless, selfish little beast, thought 
Harnet (meaning the viscount), can’t he leave his uncle alone ^ 

It was just conceivable, by the way, that Peter was quite plainly 
and simply and humanly jealous of his nephew — not, of course, of his 
relations with Hariiet (which would be disgusting and ridiculous), but 
of the careless young egotism which made those relations possible 
And, after dl, Peter had been right It was difEcult to account for 
Lord Saint-George’s impertinence without allowing people to assume 
that she was on terms with Peter which would explain that kind of thing 
It had undoubtedly made an awkwardness It was easy to say, “ Oh, yes 
I knew him slightly and went to see him when he was laid up after a 
motor accident ” She did not really very much mind if Miss Hillyard 
supposed that with a person of her dubious reputation all and any hber- 
ties might be taken But she did mmd the corollary that might be drawn 
about Peter That after five years’ patient friendship he should have 
acquired only the right to look on while his nephew romped in public 
went near to makmg him look a fool But anything else would not be 
true She had placed him m exactly that imbecile position, and she 
admitted that that was not very pretty conduct 
She went to bed thmking more about another person than about 
herself This goes to prove that even mmor poetry may have its practical 
uses 

On the following mght, a strange and sinister thing happened 
Harriet had gone, by appointment, to dine with her Somerville 
friend, and to meet a distinguished writer on the mid-Victorian period, 
from whom she expected to gain some useful information about Lefanu 
She was sitting in the friend’s room, where about half a dozen people 
were gathered to do honour to the distmguished writer, when the 
telephone rang 

** Oh, Miss Vane,” said her hostess Somebody wants you from 
Shrewsbury ” 

Harriet excused herself to the distinguished guest, and went out mto 
the small lobby in which the telephone was placed A voice which she 
could not quite recognise answered her “ Hullo * ” 

“ Is that Miss Vane^” 

« Yes — ^who’s that speaking^ ” 

“ This is Shrewsbury College Gould you please come round qmckly 
There’s been another disturbance ” 

Good heavens ’ What’s happened ^ Who is speaking, please ^ ” 

I’m speakmg for the Warden Could you please ^ ” 

“ Is that Miss Parsons ^ ” 

No, miss This is Dr Baring’s maid,” 

** But what has happened ^ ” 

SS76 



“ I don’t know, miss The Warden said I was to ask you to come at 
once ” 

“ Very well I’ll be there m about ten or fifteen minutes I haven’t got 
the car I’ll be there about ele,7en ” 

“ Very good, miss Thank you ” 

The connection was severed Harnet hurriedly got hold of her 
friend, explained that she had been called avvay suddenly, said her 
good-byes and hurried out 

She had crossed the Garden Quad and was just passing between the 
Old Hall and the Maitland Buildings, when she was visited with an 
absurd recollection She rememoered Peter’s saymg to her one day : 

“ The heroines of thrilleib deserve all they get Wien a mysterious 
voice rings them up and it is Scotland Yard, they never think of 
ringing back to verify the call Hence the prevalence of kidnapping ” 

She knew where Somerville kept its public call-box , presumably she 
could get a call from there She went in , tned it found that it was 
through to the Exchange , dialled the Shrewsbury number, and on 
getting it asked to be put through to the W arden s Lodgings 

A voice answered her , not the same person’s that had rung her up 
before 

“ Is that Dr Baring’s maid ^ ” 

“ Yes, madam Who is speaking, please ^ ” 

(“ Madam ” — the other voice had said “ miss ” Harnet knew now why 
she had felt vaguely uneasy about the call She had subconsaously 
remembered that the Warden’s maid said Madam ”) 

“ This is Miss Harnet Vane, speaking from Somerville Was it yon 
who rang me up just now ^ ” 

No, madam ” 

“ Somebody rang me up, speakmg for the Warden Was it Cook, or 
anybody else in the house ^ ” 

“ I don’t think anybody has telephoned from here, madam ” 

(Some mistake Perhaps the Warden had sent her message from some- 
where in College and she had misunderstood the speaker or the 
speaker her ) 

Could I speak to the Warden ^ ” 

“ The Warden isn’t m College, madam She went out to the theatre 
with Miss Martm I’m expecting them back any minute ” 

“ Oh, thank you Never mind There must have been some mistake 
Would you please put me back to the Lodge ^ ” 

When she heard Padgett’s voice again she asked for Miss Edwards, 
and while the connection was being made, she thought fast 

It was beginmng to look very much like a bogus call But why, m 
Heaven’s name ^ What would have happened if she had gone back to 
Shrewsbury straight awav^ Since she had not the car with her, she 
would have gone m by the private gate, past the thick bushes by the 



Fellows’ Garden— the Fellows’ Garden, where people walked by 
mght 

“ Miss Edwards isn’t in her room, Miss Vane ” 

Oh f The scouts are all in bed, I suppose ” 

“ Yes, miss Shall I ask Mrs Padgett to see if she can find her ^ ” 

“ No — see if you can get Miss Lydgate ” 

Another pause Was Miss Lydgate also out of her room ^ Was every 
reliable don in College out, or out of her room ^ Yes — ^Miss Lydgate was 
out, too , and then it occurred to Harriet that, of course, they were 
dutifully patrolling the College before turning in to bed However, there 
was Padgett She explained matters as well as she could to him 

Very good, miss,” said Padgett, comfortingly “ Yes, miss — I can 
leave Mrs Padgett on the Lodge I’ll get down to the private gate and 
have a look round Don’t you worry, naiss If there’s anybody a-laymg 
in wait for you, miss, I’m sorry for ’em, that’s all No, miss, there ain’t 
been no disturbance to-mght as I knows on , but if I catches anybody 
a-laying m wait, miss, then the disturbance wih proceed according to 
schedule, miss, trust me ” 

“ Yes, Padgett , but don’t make a row about it Slip down quietly and 
see if there’s anybody hanging round — but don’t let them see you If 
anybody attacks me when I come in, you can come to the rescue , 
but if not, keep out of sight ” 

“ Very good, miss ” 

Harnet hung up again and stepped out of the call-box A centre 
hght burned dimly in the entrance-hall She looked at the clock Seven 
minutes to eleven She would be late However, the assailant, if there 
was one, would wait for her She knew where the trap would be — must 
be Nobody would start a not just outside the Infirmary or the Warden’s 
Lodgings, where people might overhear and come out Nor would any- 
one hide under or behind the walls on that side of the path The only 
reasonable lurbng-place was the bushes in the Fellows’ Garden, near 
the gate, on the right side of the path as you went up 
One would be prepared, and that was an advantage , and Padgett 
would be somewhere at hand , but there would be a nasty moment 
when one had to turn one’s back and lock the pnvate gate from the 
inside. Hamct thought of the breadkmfe m the dummy, and shuddered 
If she bungled it and got killed— melodramatic, but possible, when 
people weren’t qmte sane — ^Peter would have something to say about it 
Perhaps it would be only decent to apologise beforehand, m case She 
found somebody’s notebook astray on a window-seat, borrowed a sheet 
of It, scnbbled half a dozen words with the pencil from her bag, folded 
the note, addressed it and put it away with the pencil If anything 
happened, it would be found 

The Somerville porter let her out into the Woodstock Road She took 
the quickest way . by St Giles’ Church, Blackball Road, Museum Road, 
27B 



South Parks Road, Mansfield Road, walking bnskly, almost running 
When she turned into Jowett Walk, she slowed down She anted her 
breath and her wits 

She turned the corner into St Cross Road, reached the gate and took 
out her key Her heart was thumping 

And then, the whole melodrama dissipated itself into po’ te comedv 
A car drew up behind her , the Dean deposited the Warden and dro^e 
on round to the tradesmen’s entrarce to garage her Austin and Dr 
Baring said pleasantly 

“ Ah • It’s you. Miss Vane ^ Now I shan’t have to look ^or mv Key 
Did you have an interesting evemng ^ The Dean and I na » e been 
indulging m a little dissipation We suddenly made up our minds after 
dinner ” 

She walked on up the path with Harriet, chatting with g’^eat amia- 
bility about the play she had seen Harriet left her at her own gate, 
refusmg an invitation to come in and have coffee and sand Arches Had 
she, or had she not, heard something stir belund the bushes ^ At anv 
rate, the opportumty was by now lost She had offered herself as tne 
cheese, but, owing to the slight delay m setting the trap, the W arden 
had innocently sprung it 

Harriet stepped into the Fellows’ Garden, switched on her torch and 
looked round The garden was empty She suddenly felt a complete 
fool Yet, when all was said and done, there must have been some 
reason for that telephone call 

She made her way towards the St Gross Lodge In the New Quad 
she met Padgett 

Ah * ” said Padgett, cautiously “ She was there ngnt enough, 
miss ” His nght hand moved at his side, and Harnet fancied it held 
something suspiciously hke a cosh “ Sittin’ on the bench be’md them 
laurels near the gate I crep’ along careful, like it was a night recon- 
noissance, miss, and ’id be’md them centre shrubs She didn’t tumble 
to me, miss But when you an’ Dr Barmg come through the gate 
a-talkmg, she was up and orf hke a shot ” 

“ WJio was It, Padgett ^ ” 

Well, miss, not to put too fine a pomt upon it, miss, it was Miss 
Tllyard She come out at the top end of the Garden, miss, and away 
to her own rooms I follered ’er and see ’er go up Going very quick, 
she was I stepped out o’ the gate, and I see the light go up in her 
window ” 

Oh 1 ” said Harnet ** Look here, Padgett I don’t want anything 
said about this I know Miss Hillyard does sometimes take a stroll in 
the Fellows’ Garden at night Perhaps the person who sent the tele- 
phone call saw her there and went away again ” 

“ Yes, miss. It’s a funny thing about that there telephone call It 
didn’t come through the Lodge, miss ” 


279 



** Perhaps one of the other instruments was through to the Exchange ” 
“ No, they wasn’t, miss I ’ad a look to see Afoie I goes to bed at 
II o’clock, I puts tlie Walden, the Dean, and the Infirmary and the 
pubhc box through, mias, for the night But they wasn’t through at 
10 40, miss, that I’ll swear ” 

“ Then the call must have come from outside ” 

“ Yes, miss Miss ’Illyard come m at 10 50, miss, jest afore you rang 
up” 

“ Did she ^ Are you sure ^ ” 

“ I remember quite well, miss, because of Annie passing a remark 
about her There’s no love lost between her and Anme,” added Padgett, 
with a chuckle “ Faults o’ both sides, that’s what I say, miss, and a 
’asty temper ” 

“ What was Anme doing in the Lodge at that hour ^ ” 

“Jest come in from her half-day out, miss She set in the Lodge a 
bit with Mrs Padgett ” 

“ Did she ^ You didn’t say anything about this business to her, did 
you, Padgett^ She doesn’t like IVIiss HiUyard, and if you ask me, I 
think she’s a mischief-maker ” 

“ I didn’t say one word, miss, not even to Mrs Padgett, and nobody 
could ’ave ’card me on the ’phone, because, after I couldn’t find Miss 
Lydgate and Miss Edwards and you begins to tell me, I shuts the door 
between me an* the settm’-room Then I jest puts me ’ead m afterwards 
and says to Mrs Padgett, * Look after the gate, v'ould you ^ ’ I says 
‘ I jest got to step over and give Mullins a message * So this here remains 
wot I might call confidential between you an’ me, miss ” 

“ Well, see that it stays confidential, Padgett I may have been 
imagimng something quite absurd The ’phone call was certainly a 
hoax, but there’s no proof that anybody meant mischief Did anybody 
else come in between 10 40 and 1 1 ^ ” 

“ Mrs Padgett wxU know, miss I’ll send you up a list of the names, 

Or if you like to step into the Lodge now ” 

“ Better not No — give me the list m the morning ” 

Harriet went away and found Miss Edwards, of whose discretion and 
common sense she had a high opimon, and told her the story of the 
’phone call 

“ You see,” said Harriet, “ if there had been any disturbance, the call 
might have been intended to prove an ahbi, though I don’t quite see 
how Otherwise, why try to get me back at deven ^ I mean, if the dis- 
turbance was due to start then, and I was brought there as a witness, 
the person might have wangled somethmg so as to appear to be else- 
where at the time But why was it necessary to have me as a witness ^ ” 
“ Yes — ^and why say the disturbance had already happened, when it 
hadn’t? And why wouldn’t you do as a witness when you had the 
Warden with you ^ ” 



** Of course,” said Harriet, the idea might have been to male a 
disturbance and bring me on to the scene m time to be suspected of 
having done it myself ” 

“ That would be silly, everybody knows joi/ can*t be tlie Poltergeist ” 
“ Well, then, we come back to my fi^st idea I v^as to be attacked 
But why couldn t I be attacked at midnight or anv other time ^ Why 
bring me back at eie\ en ^ ” 

“ It couldn’t have been sometlung timed to go off at eleven, while the 
ahbi was being established ^ ” 

“ Nobody could know to a moment the exact time I should take 
coming from Somerv’ilie to Shi ew’s bury Uniesi> you are thinking of a 
bomb or something that would go oiT when the gate was opened But 
that would work equally well af anv time ” 

“ But if the alibi was fixed for eleven ” 

Then why didn’t the bomb go off ^ As a matter of fact, I simply 
can’t believe m a bomb at all ” 

“ Nor can I — not reallv,” said Miss Edvvards “ We’re just being 
theoretical I suppose Padgett saw nothing suspicious ^ ” 

“ Only Miss Hillyard,” replied Haiiiet, lightly, “ sitting in the 
Feliom’ Garden ” 

« Oh » ” 

“ She does go there sometimes at mght , I’ve seen hei Perhaps she 
frightened away — ^whatever it was ” 

“ Perhaps,” said Miss Edwards By the way, your noble fnend seems 
to have overcome her prejudices in a remarkable manner I don’t mean 
the one who saluted you in the quad — the one who came to dinner ” 

“ Are you trying to make a mystery out of yesterday afternoon ? ” 
asked Harriet, smiling ‘‘ I think it was only a matter of introductions 
to some man in Italy who owns a hbrary ” 

“ So she informed us,” said Miss Edwards Harriet realised that, 
when her own back was turned, a good deal of chaff must have been 
fiymg about the History Tutor’s ears Well,” Miss Edwards went on, 
“ I promised him a paper on blood-groups, but he hasn’t started to 
badger me for it yet He’s an interesung man isn’t he ^ ” 

“ To the biologist ^ ” 

Miss Edwards laughed “ Well, yes — as a specimen of the pedigree 
animal Shockmgly overbred, but full of nervous intelligence. But I 
didn’t mean that ” 

“ To the woman, then ^ ” 

Miss Edwards turned a candid eye on Harriet 
“To many women, I should imagine ” 

Harriet met the eye with a level gaze 
“ I have no information on that pomt ” 

“ Ah * ” said Miss Edwards “ In your novels, you deal more in 
matenal facts than in psychology, don’t you ^ ” 

281 



Harriet readily admitted that this was so 

** Well, never imndj” said Miss Edwards, and said good mght rather 
brusquely 

Harnet asked herself what all this was about Oddly enough, it had 
never yet occurred to her to wonder what other women made of Peter, 
or he of them This must argue eitlier very great confidence or very 
great indifference on her own part , for, when one came to think of it, 
eligibility wa& his middle name 

On reaching her room, she took the scribbled note from her bag and 
destroyed it without re-reading it Even the thought of it made her 
blush Heroics that don’t come off are the very essence of burlesque 


Thursday was chiefly remarkable for a violent, prolonged and wholly 
inexplicable row between Miss Hiliyard and Miss Chiipenc, in the 
Fellows’ Garden after Hall How it started or what it was about, nobody 
could afterwards remember Somebody had disarranged a pile of books 
and papers on one of the Library tables, with the result that a History 
Schools candidate had arrived for a coaching v^tli a tale of a set of 
notes mislaid or missing Miss Hiliyard, whose temper had been ex- 
ceedingly short all day, was moved to take the matter personally and, 
after glowenng all through dinner, burst out — as soon as the Warden 
had gone — into a storm of indignation against the world in general 
** Why my pupils should always be the ones to suffer from other 
people’s carelessness, I don’t know,” said Miss Hiliyard 
Miss Burrows said she didn’t see that they suffered more than anybody 
else Miss Hiliyard angrily adduced instances extending over the past 
three terms of History students whose work had been interfered with by 
what looked like deliberate persecution 
" Considering,” she went on, “ that the History School is the largest 

in the College and certainly not the least important ” 

Miss Chiipenc pointed out, quite correctly, that m that particular 
year there happened to be more candiaates for the English School than 
any other 

“ Of course you would say that,” said Miss Hiliyard “ There may be 
a couple more this year — I dare say there may — diough why we should 
need an extra English tutor to cope with them, when I have to grapple 
smgle-handed ” 

It was at that pomt that the origin of the quarrel became lost in a fog 
of personalities, in the course of which Miss Chiipenc was accused of 
insolence, arrogance, inattention to her work, general incompetence 
and a desire to attract notice to herself The extreme wildness of these 
charges left poor Miss Chiipenc quite bewildered Indeed, nobody 
seemed to be able to make anythmg of it, except, perhaps, Miss Edwards, 
who sat with a gnm smile liattmg herself a silk jumper. At length the 
282 



attack extended itself from Miss Ghilpenc to Miss Ghiiperic^s Sanc^ 
whose scholarship was submitted to scathing criticism 
Miss Ghilpenc rose up, trembling. 

“ I think, Miss Hilly ard,” she said, ** you must be beside yourself 
I do not mind what you say about me, but I cannot sit here w hiie you 
insult Jacob Peppercorn ” She stumbled a little o\er tne syllables of 
this unfortunate name, and Miss Hilly ard laughed unkindly Mr 
Peppercorn is a very fine scholar,” pursued Mss Ghilpenc, with rising 

anger as of an exasperated lamb, “ and I insist that ” 

“ Pm glad to hear you say so,” said I^Iiss Hiilyard ** If I were vou, 
I should make do with him ” 

“ I don’t know what you mean,” cried Miss Ghilpenc 
“ Perhaps Miss Vane could tell you,” retorted Miss Hiilyard, and 
walked away without another word 

“ Good gracious * ” cried Miss Ghilpenc, turning to Harnet " What- 
ever is she talking about ^ ” 

“ I haven’t the least idea,” said Harnet 

“ I don’t know, but I can guess,” said Mss Edw^ards “ If people will 
bring dynamite into a powder factory, they must expect explosions ” 
While Harriet was rooting about in tne back of her mind for some 
association that these words called up, Miss Edwards went on 
“ If somebody doesn’t get to the bottom of these disturbances within 
the next few days, there’ll be murder done If we’re like this now, 
what’s gomg to happen to us at the end of term ^ You ought to have 
had the police in from the start, and if I’d been here, I’d have said so 
I’d like to deal with a good, stupid sergeant of pohce for a change ” 
Then she, too, got up and stalked away, leavmg the rest of the dons 
to stare at one another

O well-kmt Samson ^ strong-jointed Samson ' I do excel thee in 
my rapier, as much as thou didst excel me in carrymg gates I 
am m love, too 

WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE 

Harriet had been only too right about Wilfrid She had spent portions 
of four days in altering and humanising Wilfrid, and to-day, after a 
distressful morning with him, had reached the dismal conclusion tiiat 
she would have to rewrite the whole thing from the beginning Wilfrid’s 
tormented humanity stood out now against the competent vacuity of 
the other characters hke a wound Moreover, with the reduction of 



Wilfrid’s motives to what was psychologically credible, a large lump of 
the plot had fallen out, leaving a gap through which one could catch 
glimpses of new and exciting jungles of intrigue She stood aimlessly 
staring in the window of the antique shop Wilfrid was becoming 
like one of those coveted ivory chessmen You probed into bis interior 
and discovered an mtncate and delicate carved sphere of sensibilities, 
and, as you turned it m your fingers, you found another inside that, 
and within that, another again 

Behind the table where the chessmen stood was a Jacobean dresser 
m black oak, and, as she stood at gaze, a set of features hmned them- 
selves pallidly against the dark background, like Pepper’s ghost 

“ What IS It ^ ” asked Peter over her shoulder , ‘ Toby jugs or pewter 
pots or the dubious chest with Brummagem handles ^ ” 

“ The chessmen,” said Harriet “ I have fallen a victim to them I 
don’t know why I have no possible use for them. It’s just one of those 
bewitchments.’* 

“ ‘ The reason no man know^s, let it suflSce What we behold is 
censured by our eyes * To be possessed is an admirable reason for 
posscssmg ” 

“ What would they want for them, I wonder ^ ” 

If they’re complete and genuine, anything fiom forty to eighty 
pounds ” 

Too much When did you get back ^ ” 

“Just before lunch I was on my way to see you Were you going 
anywhere m particular ^ ” 

« No— just wandenng Have you foimd out anything useful ^ ” 

“ I have been scouring England for a man called Arthur Robinson 
Does the name mean anything to you ^ ” 

“ Nothing whatever ** 

“ Nor to me I approached it wuth a refreshing absence of prejudice 
Have there been any developments in College ^ ” 

“ Well, yes Somethmg rather queer happened the other night 
Only I don’t quite understand it ” 

“ Will you come for a run and tell me about it ^ I’ve got the car, and 
It’s a fine afternoon ” 

Hamet looked round, and saw the Daimler parked by the kerb 
“ I’d love to ” 

“ We’ll dawdle along the lanes and have tea somewhere,” he added, 
conventionally, as he handed her m 
“ How onginai of you, Peter * ” 

“ Isn’t It ^ ” They moved decorously down the crowded High Street 
“ There’s something hypnotic about the word tea. I am asking you to 
enjoy the beauties of the English countryside, to tell me your adventures 
and hear mine, to plan a campaign involving the comfort and repu- 
tation of two hundred people, to honour me with your sole presence 
284 



and bestow upon me the illusion of Paiadise*— and I speak cu: thougii 
the pre-eminent object of all desire were a pot of boiled water and a 
plateful of synthetic pastries in Ye Olde Worfde Tudor Tea-Snoppe ’ 

“ If we dawdle till after opening-time,*’ said Harriet, practical’ , “ we 
can get bread-and-cheese and beer m the \iilage pub ** 

Now you have said something 

The crystal spnngs, whose taste illuminates 
Refined eyes with an eternal sight 
Like tridd silver, run through Parad.se 
To entertain divine Zenocrate ** 

Harriet could find no adequate reply to this, but sat aicnj:'g his 
hands as they lay lightly on the driving-wheel The car passed on tiirough 
Long Marston out to Marston and Eisfield Present Iv he nirnea it into 
a side-road and thence into a lane and there drew up 
“ There comes a moment when one must cease voyag rg tnrough 
strange seas of thought alone Will you speak first, or shall I ^ ’ 

“ Who is Arthur Robinson ^ ** 

“ Arthur Robinson is the gentleman who behaved so stra-'geh n the 
matter of a thesis He was an M A of York Umversity, .ic d \anous 
tutorships from time to time m various seats of learmng, app'ied for 
the Chair of Modern History at York, and there came up aga nst the 
formidable memory and detective ability of your Miss de \ me ■'vho was 
then Head of Flamborough College and on the examim-^g body He 
was a fair, handsome man, aged about thirty-five at the t»me, very 
agreeable and popular, though hampered a little in his soc.a^ career 
by having in a weak moment married his landlady’s daughter After 
the unfortunate episode of the thesis, he disappeared from acadenuc 
arcles, and was no more heard of At the time of his disanpearance he 
had one female child of two years of age and another expected I 
managed to hunt up a former frxend of his, who said that he had neard 
nothing of Robinson since the disaster^ but fancied that he had gone 
abroad and changed his name He referred me to a man cai ea Simpson 
hvmg in Nottmgham I pursued Simpson, and found that he had in 
the most inconvenient way, died last year I returned to Loncon and 
dispatched sundry members of Miss Chmpson’s Bureau .n sea^c^ of 
other fnends and colleagues of Mr Arthur Robinson, ana a'so to 
Somerset House to hunt through the Marnage and Bir'^h Registers 
That is all I have to show for two days of intensive act3Vi*% — except 
that I honourably delivered your manuscript to your secretan *’ 

“ Thank you very much Arthur Robinson Do you think he can 
possibly have anything to do with it ^ ’* 

“ Well, It’s rather a far cry But it’s a fact that until Miss de \mc 
came here there were no disturbances, and the only thing she has ever 

iiBs 



mentioned that might suggest a personal enmity is the story of Arthur 
Robinson It seemed just worth while following up ” 

“ Yes, I see I hope you’re not going to suggest that Miss Hill- 
yard is Arthur Robinson m disguise, because Fve known her for ten 
years ” 

Why Miss Hillyard ^ What’s she been doing ^ ” 

“ Nothing susceptible of proof ” 

« Tell me ” 

Harnet told him the story of the telephone call, to which he listened 
with a grave face 

“ Was I making a mountain out of a mole-hiil ^ ” 

“ I think not I think our fnend has realised that you are a danger 
and IS minded to tackle you first Unless it is a quite separate feud— 
which is just possible On the whole it’s as well that you thought of 
nnging back ” 

“You may take the credit for that I hadn’t forgotten your scathing 
remarks about the thnller-herome and the bogus message from Scotland 
Yard ” 

“ Hadn’t you ^ Hamet, will you let me show you how to meet 
an attack if it ever does come ^ ” 

“ Meet a Yes, I should like to know Though I’m fairly strong, 

you know I think I could cope with most things, except a stab in the 
back That was what I rather expected ” 

“ I doubt if it will be that,” said he, coolly “ It makes a mess and 
leaves a messy weapon to be disposed of Stranghng is cleaner and 
quicker and makes no noise to speak of ” 

“ Yeough » ” 

“ You have a mce throat for it,” pursued his lordship, thoughtfully 
“ It has a kind of arum-hly quahty that is m itself an invitation to 
violence I do not want to be run in by the local bobby for assault, but 
if you will kmdly step aside with me into this convement field, it will 
give me great pleasure to strangle you scientifically in several positions ” 
“ You’re a gruesome compamon for a day’s outing ” 

“ I’m qmte serious ” He had got out of the car and was holding the 
door open for her “ Come, Harriet I am very civilly pretending that 
I don’t care what dangers you run You don’t want me to howl at your 
feet, do you ^ ” 

“ You’re going to make me feel ignorant and helpless,” said Harriet, 
following him nevertheless to the nearest gate “ I don’t like it ” 

“ Ihis field will do charmingly It is not laid down for hay, it is 
reasonably free from thistles and cow-pats, and there is a high hedge 
to screen us from the road ” 

** And It IS soft to fail on and has a pond to throw the corjise into 
if you get earned away by your enthusiasm Very well. I have said my 
prayers.” 

286 



“‘'rhen kindly imagine me to be an unpleasant-faced thug with 
designs on your purse, your virtue and >our life ” 

The next few minutes were rather breathless 

‘‘ Don’t thrash about,” said Peter, imldly “ You’ll onlv exhaust 
yourself Use my weight to upset me with I’m putimg it entirely at 
your disposal, and I can’t throw it about m two directions at once 
If you let my vaulting ambition overleap itself, I shall faU on the other 
side with the beautiful precision of Newton’s apple ” 

“ I don’t get that ” 

“ Try throttling me for a change, and I’ll show you ” 

Did I say this field was soft ^ ” said Harriet, when her feet had been 
ignomimously hooked from under her She rubbed herself resentfully 
“ Just let me do it to you, that’s ail ” 

And this time, whether by skill or favour, she did contrive to bnng 
him off his balance, so that he only saved himself from sprawling by a 
complicated twist suggestive of an eel on a hook 
“ We’d better stop now,” said Peter, when he had instructed her in 
the removal of the thug who leaps from in front, the thug who dives 
m from behind, and the more sophisticated thug who starts operations 
with a silk scarf ** You’ll feel to-morrow as if you’d been playing foot- 
baU” 

“ I think I shall have a sore throat ” 

** I’m sorry Did I let my animal nature get the better of me ^ That’s 
the worst of these rough sports ” 

“ It would be a good bit rougher if it was done in earnest I shouldn’t 
care to mett you in a narrow lane on a dark night, and I only hope the 
Poison-Pen hasn’t been making a study of the subject Peter, you don’t

I avoid serious thought like the plague But I assure you I haven’t 
been knocking you about for the fun of it ” 

** I believe you No gentleman could throttle a lady more 
impersonally ” 

Thank you for the testimomai Cigarette ” 

Harnet took the cigarette, which she felt she had deserved, and sat 
with her hands about her knees, mentally turmng the incidents of the 
last hour into a scene m a book (as is the novelist’s unpleasant habit) 
and thinking how, with a little vulgarity on both sides, it could be 
worked up into a mce piece of exhibitionism for the male and provoca- 
tion for the female concerned. With a little manipulation it might come in 
for the chapter where the wart Everard w^as due to seduce the glamorous 
but neglected wife, Sheila He could lock her to him, knee to knee 
and breast to breast in an unbreakable grip and smile challengingiy 
mto her flushed face , and Sheila could go all limp— at which point 
Everard could either ram fierce kisses on her mouth, or say, “ My 
God ! don’t tempt me I ” which would come to exactly the same thing 



m the end “ It would suit them very well/’ thought Harriet, ** the 
cheap skates ^ ” and passed an exploring finger under the angle 
of her jaw, where the pressure of a relentless thumb had left its 
memory 

“Cheer up,” said Peter “ It’ll wear off” 

** Do you propose to give Miss de Vine lessons in self-defence ^ ” 

“ I’m rather bothered about her She’s got a groggy heart, hasn’t 
she^” 

“ She’s supposed to have She wouldn’t climb Magdalen Tower ” 

“ And presumably she wouldn’t rush round College and steal fuses 
or climb m and out of windows In which case the hairpins would be 
a plant Which brings us back to the Robinson theory But it’s easy 
to pretend your heart is worse than it is Ever seen her have a heart- 
attack ^ ” 

** Now you mention *t, I have not ” 

“ You see,” said Peter, “ she put me on to Robinson I gave her the 
opportunity to tell a story, and she told it Next day, I went to see her 
and asked for the name She made a good show of reluctance, but she 
gave it It’s easy to throw suspicion on people who owe you a grudge, 
and that without telling any lies If I wanted you to beheve that some- 
body was having a smack at me, I could give you a list of enemies as 
long as my arm ” 

“ I suppose so Do they ever try to do you in ^ ” 

“ Not very often Occasionally they send silly things by post Shaving- 
cream full of nasty bugs and so on And there was a gentleman with 
a pill calculated to cure lassitude and debility I had a long corre- 
spondence with him, all in plain envelopes The beauty of his system 
was that he made you pay for the pill, which still seems to me a very 
fine touch In fact, he took me m completely , he only made the one 
tnfimg miscalculation of supposing that I wanted the pill — and I can’t 
really blame him for that, because the list of symptoms I produced for 
him would have led anybody to suppose I needed the whole pharma- 
copoeia However, he sent me a week’s supply — ^seven pills — at shocking 
expense , so I virtuously toddled round with them to my friend at the 
Home Office who deals with charlatans and immoral advertisements and 
so on, and he was inquisitive enough to analyse them ' H’m,’ said he, 
‘ six of ’em would nci&er make nor mar you , but the other would cure 
lassitude all right ’ So I natmally asked what was m it ‘ Strychmne,’ 
said he * Full lethal dose If you want to go rolling round the room 
like a hoop with your head touchmg your heels. I’ll guarantee the 
result ’ So we went out to look for the gentleman ” 

** Did you find him ^ ” 

Oh, yes Dear old fnend of mine Had him m the dock before on a 
cocame charge We put him in jug— and I’m dashed if, when he came 
out, he didn’t try to blackmail me on the strength of the pill correspond-

ence* 1 never met a scoundrel I liked better Would you care for a 
little more healthy exerciscj or shall we take the road again ^ ” 

It was when they were passing through a small town that Peter caught 
sight of a leather-and-hames& shop, and pulled up suddenly 
“ I know what you want,” he said “ You want a dog-collar I’m 
going to get you one The kind with brass knobs ” 

** A dog-collar Whatever for As a badge of ownership ^ ” 

“ God forbid To guard against the bites of sharks Evceiient also 
against tiiugs and throat-shtters ” 

“ My dear man * ” 

“ Honestly It’s too stiff to squeeze and it’ll turn the edge of a blade — 
and even ii anybody hangs you by it, it won’t choke you as a rope would 
“ I can’t go about m a dog-coliar ” 

** Weil, not m the day-time But it would give confidence when 
patrolling at night And you could sleep in it with a httie practice Ifou 
needn’t bother to come in — I’ve had my Hands round your neck often 
enough to guess the size ” 

He vanished into the shop and was seen through the window con- 
fernng with the proprietor Presently he came out witn a parcel and took 
the wheel again 

“ The man was very much interested,” he observed, in my bull- 
terrier bitch Extremely plucky ammal, but reckless and obstinate 
fighter Personally, he said, he preferred greyhounds He told me where 
I could get my name and address put on the collar, but I said that could 
wait Now we’re out of the town, you can try it on ” 

He drew m to the side of the road for this purpose, and assisted her 
(with, Harriet fancied, a touch of self-satisfaction), to buckle the heavy 
strap It was a massive kind of necklace and quite surprisingly uncom- 
fortable Harriet fished m her bag for a hand-mirror and sur\eyed the 
effect 

“ Rather becoming, don’t you think ^ ” said Peter I don’t see why 
It shouldn’t set a new faslnon ” 

“ I do,” said Harnet “ Do you mmd taking it ofif again ” 

“Will you wear It 

“ Suppose somebody grabs at it from behind ” 

“ Let go and fail back on them — heavily You’il fall soft, and with 
luck they’ll crack their skull open ” 

“ Bloodthirsty monster Very well I’ll do anything you hkc if you’ll 
take It off now ” 

“ That’s a promise,” said he, and released her “ That collar,” he 
added, wrapping it up again and laying it on her knee, “ deserves to be 
put m a glass case ” 

“ Whv>” 

“ It’s the only thmg you’ve ever let me give you ” 

“ Except my life — except my life — except my life ”

“ Damn * ” said Peter, and stared out angrily over the wind-screen 
It must have been a pretty bittei gift, if you can’t let either of us forget 

it ” 

“ Fm sorry, Peter That was ungenerous and beastly of me You shall 
give me something if you want to ” 

“ May I ^ What shall I give you ^ Roc’s eggs are cheap to-day ” 

For a moment her mind was a blank Whatever she asked him for, it 
must be something adequate The trivial, the commonplace or the 
merely expensive would all be equally insulting And he would know m 
a moment if she was inventing a want to please him 
“ Peter — give me the ivory chessmen ” 

He looked so delighted that she felt sure he had expected to be snubbed 
with a request for something costmg seven-and-sixpence 
My dear — of course * Would you like them now ^ ” 

** Tins instant ’ Some miserable undergraduate may be snapping them 
up Every day I go out I expect to find them gone Be quick ” 

All right I’ll engage not to drop below seventy, except m the thirty- 
mile limit ” 

** Oh, God ’ ” said Harriet, as the car started Fast driving terrified 
her, as he very well knew After five breath-taking miles, he shot a 
glance sideways at her, to see how she was standing it, and slacked his 
foot from the accelerator 

“ That was my tnumph song Was it a bad four minutes ^ ” 

“ I asked for it,” said Hamet, with set teeth ” Go on ” 

“ I’m damned if I will We will go at a reasonable pace and risk the 
undergraduate, damn his bones * ” 

The ivory chessmen were, however, still in the window when they 
arnved Peter subjected them to a hard and monocled stare, and said 
“ They look all nght ” 

” They’re lovely Admit that when I do do a thing, I do it handsomely 
I’ve asked you now for thirty-two presents at once ” 

“ It sounds like Through the Looking-Glass Are you coming in, or will 
you leave me to fight it out by myself^ ” 

“ Of course I’m coming m Why ^ — Oh * Am I looking too keen ^ ” 

“ Much too keen ” 

“ Well, I don’t care I’m coming m ” 

The shop was dark, and crowded with a strange assortment of first- 
class stuff, junk, and traps for the unwary The propnetor, however, had 
all his wits about him and, recogmsmg after a prehminary skirmish of 
superlatives that he had to do with an obstinate, expenenced and well- 
informed customer, settied down with something like enthusiasm to a 
prolonged siege of the position It had not previously occurred to Hamet 
that anybody could spend an hour and forty minutes in buying a set of 
chessmen Every separate carved ball m every one of thirty-two pieces 
had to be separately and minutely examined with finger-tips and the 
ago 



naked eye and a waldbrnaker’s lens for signs of damage, repair, substitu- 
tion or faulty workmanship , and only after a sharp catechism directed 
to the provenance ” of the set, and a long discussion about trade 
conditions in China, the state of the antique market generally and the 
effect of the Amencan slump on prices, was any figure mentioned at all , 
and when it was mentioned, it was instantly challenged, and a further 
discussion followed, during w^hich ail the pieces were scrutinised again 
This ended at length m Peter’s agreemg to purchase the set at the price 
named (which was considerably abov^e his minimum, though within his 
maximum estimate) provided the board vvas included The unusual size 
of the pieces made it necessary that they should have their own board , 
and the dealer rather reluctantly agreed, after having it firmly pointed 
out to him that the board was sixteenth-century Spanish — clean out of 
the period — and that it was therefore almost a condescension on the 
purchaser’s part to accept it as a gift 
The combat being now brought to an honourable conclusion, the 
dealer beamed pleasantly and asked where the parcel should be sent 
** We’ll take it with us,” said Peter, firmly “ If you’d rather have notes 
than a cheque ” 

The dealer protested that the cheque would be quite all nght but that 
the parcel would be a large one and take some time to make up, since 
the pieces ought all to be wrapped separately 
" We’re in no hurry,” said Peter ** We’il take it with us ” , thus 
conforming to the first rule of good nursery behaviour, that presents must 
always be taken and never delivered by the shop 
The dealer vanished upstairs to look for a suitable box, and Peter 
turned apologetically to Harriet 

“ Sorry to be so long about it You’ve chosen better than you knew 
I’m no expert, but I’m very much mistaken if that isn’t a very fine and 
ancient set, and worth a good bit more than he wants for it Ihat’s why 
I haggled so much When a tiling looks like a bargain, there’s usually a 
snag about it somewhere If one of those dashed pawns wasn’t the 
ongmal, it would make the whole lot worthless ” 

“ I suppose so ” A disqmetmg thought struck Harriet If the set 
hadn’t been perfect, should you have bought it ^ ” 

“ Not at any price.” 

“ Not if I stiU wanted It’” 

** No That’s the snag about me Besides, you wouldn’t want it You 
have the scholarly mmd and you’d always feel uncomfortable knowing it 
was wrong, even if nobody else knew ” 

That’s true Whenever anybody admired it I should feel obhgcd to 
say, ‘ Yes, but one of the pawns is modern ’—and that would get so 
tedious Well, I’m glad they’re all right, because I love them with a 
perfectly idiotic passion They have been hauntmg my slumbers for 
weeks And even now I haven’t said thank you ” 

29 ^ 



. I wonder 


“ Yes, you have— -and anyway, the pleasure is all mine 
whether that spinet’s in ordei ” 

He threaded his way through the dark backward and abysm of the 
antique shop, clearing away a spinning-wheel, a Georgian wine- 
cooler, a brass lamp and a small forest of Burmese idols that stood 
between him and the instrument “ Variations on a musical-box,” he 
said, as he ran his fingers over the keys, and, disentangling a coffin-stool 
from his surroundings, sat down and played, first a minuet from a Bach 
suite and then a gigue, before striking into the air of Greensleeves 
“ Alas * my love, you do me wrong 
To cast me off discourteously. 

And I have lovM you so long, 

Delighting in your company ” 

He shall see that I don’t mind that, thought Harriet, and raised her 
voice cheerfully m the refrain 

** For O Greensleeves was all my joy. 

And O Greensleeves was my delight ” 

He stopped playing instantly 

“ Wrong key for you God meant you for a contralto ” He transposed 
die air into E minor, m a tinkling cascade of modulations “ You never 
told me you could sing . • No, I can hear you’re not trained , * 
chorus-singer ^ Bach Choir ^ • of course — I might have guessed it 

• . * And O Greensleeves was my heart of gold And who but my Lady 
Greensleeves * • Do you know any of Morley’s Canzonets for Two 

Voices ^ . . Come on, then, ‘ When lo * by Break of Morning * 

Whichever part you like — they’re exactly the same . ‘ My love 
herself adorning,’ • . G natural my dear, G natural ” 

The dealer, descendmg with his arms full of packing materials, paid 
no attention to them He was well accustomed to the eccentricities of 
customers ; and, moreover, probably chenshed hopes of selling them the 
spinet 

“ This kind of thing,” said Peter, as tenor and alto twined themselves 
in a last companionable cadence, “ is the body and bones of music 
Anybody can have the harmony, if they will leave us the counterpoint 
What next ? ‘ Go to Bed, sweet Muse ’ ^ Gome, come * Is it true ^ 

IS It kmd ^ is it necessary ? • , ‘ Love is a fancy, love is a frenzy ’ 

Very well, I owe you one for that,” and with a mischievous eye he played 
the opemng bars of * Sweet Cupid, Ripen her Desire ’ 

” No,” said Harriet, reddemng 

** No Not m the best of taste Try again ” 

He hesitated , ran from one tune to another , then settled down to 
that best-known of all Elizabethan love-songs 
“ Fam would I change that note 
To which fond love hath charmed me ” 

29 Si 



Harriet, with her elbows on the hd of the spinet and her chm propped 
on her hands, let him sing alone Two young gentlemen, who had strayed 
m and were talking rather loudly in the front part of the shop, abandoned 
a half-hearted quest for brass candlesticks and came stumbling through 
the gloom to see who was making the noise 

True house of joy and bliss 
Where sweetest pleasure is 
I do adore thee , 

I see thee what thou art, 

I love thee m my heart 
And fail before thee ” 

Tobias Hume’s excellent air rises to a high-pitched and tnumpbant 
challenge in the penultimate line, before tumbling with a clatter to the 
key-note Too late, Harriet signed to the smger to moderate his voice 
“ Here, you * ” said the larger of the two young gentlemen, belliger- 
ently, “ You’re making a filthy row Shut up ' ” 

Peter swung round on the stool 

“ Sir ^ ” He polished his monocle with exaggerated care, adjusted it 
and let his eye travel up the immeme tweedy form lowering over him 
“ I beg your pardon Was that obhgin’ observation addressed to me ^ ” 
Hamet started to speak, but the young man turned to her 
“ Who,” he demanded loudly, ** is this cSeminate bounder ^ ” 

“ I have been accused of many things,” said Wimsey, mtcrcsted , 
“ but the charge of effeminacy is new to me Do you mind explaimng 
yourself^ ” 

** I don’t like your song,” said the young man, rocking slightly on his 
feet, and I don’t like your voice, and I don’t like your tom-fool 
eye-glass ” 

” Steady on, Reggie,” said his friend 

“You’re annoying this lady,” persisted the young man “You’re making 
her conspicuous Get out * ” 

“ Good God • ” said Wimsey, turmng to Hamet “ Is this by any 
chance Mr Jones of Jesus ^ ” 

“ Who arc you calling a bloody Welshman ^ ” snarled the young man, 
much exasperated “ My name’s Pomfret ” 

“ Mme’s Wimsey,” said Peter “ Quite as ancient though less euphon- 
ious Gome on, son, don’t be an ass You mustn’t behave like this to 
semor members and before ladies ” 

“ Semor membei be damned * ” cned Mr Pomfret, to whom this 
unfortxmate phrase conveyed only too much ‘ Do you think I’m going 
to be sneered at by you ^ Stand up, blast you * why can’t you stand up 
for yourself^ ” 

“ First,” r^hed Peter, mildly, “ because I’m twenty years older than 



you are Secondly, because you’re six inches taller than I am And 
thirdly, because I don’t want to hurt you ” 

** Then ” said Mr Pomfret, “ take that, you sitting rabbit * ” 

He launched an impetuous blow at Peter’s head, and found hinaseif 
held by the wrist in an iron grip 

If you don’t keep quiet,” said his lordship, “ you’ll break something 
Here, you, sir Take your effervescent friend home, can’t you ^ How the 
devil does he come to be drunk at this time of the day ^ ” 

The friend offered a confused explanation about a lunch-party and 
subsequent cocktail binge Peter shook his head 
** One damn gm after another,” he said, sadly “ Now, sir You had 
better apologise to the lady and beetle off ” 

Mr Pomfret, much subdued and tending to become lachrymose, 
muttered that he was sorry to have made a row “ But why did you make 
fun of me with that ^ ” he asked Harriet, reproachfully 
“ I didn’t, Mr Pomfret You’re quite mistaken ” 

‘ Damn your semor members ’ ” said Mr Pomfret 
“ Now, don’t begin all over again,” urged Peter, kindly He got up, 
his eyes about on a level with Mr Pomfret’s chin “ If you want to 
continue the discussion, you’ll find me at the Mitre in the morning This 
way out ” 

Come on, Reggie,” said the friend 

The dealer, who had returned to his packing after assuring himself 
that it would not be necessary to send for the police or the proctors, 
leapt helpfully to open the door, and said “ Good afternoon, gentlemen,” 
as though nothing out of the way had happened 
** I’m damned if I’ll be sneered at,” said Mr Pomfret, endeavouring 
to stage a come-back on the doorstep 
“ Of course not, old boy,” said his friend Nobody’s sneering at you 
Come on * You’ve had quite enough fim for one afternoon ” 

The door shut them out 
‘‘WeU,wcUt” said Peter. 

“ Young gentlemen will be hvely,” said the dealer I’m afraid it’s 
a bit bulky, sir, I’ve put the board up separate ” 

“ Stick ’em m the car,” said Peter ** They’ll be all nght ” 

This was done , and the dealer, glad enough to get his shop cleared, 
began to put up his shutters, as it was now long past closmg-time 
“ I apologise for my yoimg fnend,” said Harriet 
“ He seems to have taken it hard What on earth was there so 
infuriating about my being a semor ^ ” 

“ Oh, poor lamb * He thought I’d been tellmg you about him and me 
and the proctor I suppose I had better tell you now ” 

Peter listened and laughed a little ruefully 

“ I’m sorry,” he said. " That kmd of thmg hurts hke hell when you^re 
his age. I’d better send him a note and set that right I say I ” 
a94 



“ What?” 

“We never had that beer Come round and have one with me at the 
Mitre, and we’ll concoct a salve for wounded feelings ” 

With two half-pint tankards on the table before them, Peter produced 
his epistle 

The Mtre Hotel, 
Oxford 

To Regmald Pomfret, Esq 
Sir, 

I am given to understand bv Miss Vane that in the course of our 
comersation this afternoon I unhappily made use of an expression 
which might have been misconstrued as a reference to vour pnvate 
affairs Permit me to assure you that the words were uttered m Com- 
plete Ignorance, and that nothing could ha\e oeen farther from my 
intentions than to make anv such offensive allusion While deprecating 
very strongly the behaviour you thought fit to use, I desire to express 
my sincere regret for any pam I may ha\e inadvertently caused >ou, 
and beg to remam, 

Your obedient servant, 

Peter Death Bredon W^imsey 


“ Is that pompous enough ^ ” 

“ Beautiful,” said Harriet “ Scarcely a word undoi three syllables 
and all the names you’ve got What your nephew calls ' Uncle Peter at 
his stuflSest ’ All it wants is the crest and sealmg-wax Whv wTite the 
child a mce, friendly note ^ ” 

“ He doesn’t want fnendliness,” said his lordship, grinning “ He wants 
satisfaction ” He rang the bell and sent the w^aiter for Bunter and the 
sealing-wax “ You’re nght about the beneficidi effects of a red seal — 
he’ll think it’s a challenge Bunter, bnng me my seal nng Come to 
thmk of it, that’s an idea Shall I offer him the choice of swords or pistols 
on Port Meadow at daybreak ^ ” 

“ I think It’s time you grew up,” said Hamet 

“ Is it ^ ” said Peter, addressmg the envelope “ I’ve never challenged 
anybody It would be fun I’ve been challenged three times and fought 
twice , the third time the police butted in I’m afraid that was because 
my opponent didn’t fancy my choice of w'-eapon Thanks, Bunter- 
A bullet, you see, may go anywhere, but steel’s almost bound to go 
somewhere ” 

“ Peter,” said Harriet, looking gravely at him, “ I believe you’re 
showing off.” 

“ I believe I am,” said he, setting the heavy ring accurately down 
upon the wax “ Every cock will crow upon his own dung-hill ” His gnn 
was half petulant, half deprecating “ I hate being loomed over by 
gigantic undergraduates and made to feel my age ”

CHAPTER XX 


For, to speak in a word, envy is naught else but trutiUa de horns 
alunts, sorrow for other men’s good, be it present, past, or to 
come and gaudium de advmis^ and joy at their harms ’T]s 

a common disease, and almost natural to us, as Tacitus holds, to 
envy another man’s prospenty 

ROBERT BURTON 

It is said that love and a cough cannot be hid Nor is it easy to hide two- 
and-thirty outsize ivory chessmen , unless one is so inhuman as to leave 
them swaddled in their mummy-clothes of wadding and entombed 
within the six sides of a wooden sarcophagus What is the use of acquinng 
one’s heart’s desire if one cannot handle and gloat over it, show it to one’s 
friends and gather an anthology of envy and admiration^ Whatever 
awkward deductions might be drawn about the giver — and, after ail, was 
that anybody’s business ^ — ^Harnet knew that she must needs display the 
gift or burst in solitary ecstasy 

Accordingly, she put a bold face on it, marched her forces openly into 
the Semor Common Room after Hall, and deployed them upon the 
table, with the eager assistance of the dons 
“ But where are you going to keep them ^ ” asked the Dean, when 
everybody had sufficiently exclaimed over the fineness of the carving, 
and had taken her turn at twisting and examimng the nests of concentric 
globes “ You can’t just leave them in the box Look at those fragile 
little spears and things and the royal head-dresses They ought to be put 
in a glass case.” 

** I know,” said Harriet “ It’s just like me to want something com- 
pletely impracticable I shall have to wrap them all up agam ” 

“ Only then,” said Miss Ghilperic, ‘‘ you won’t be able to look at them 
I know, if they were mine, I shotddn’t be able to take my eyes off them for 
a moment ” 

You can have a glass case if you like,” said Miss Edwards. Out of 
the Science Lecture-Room ” 

“ The very thing,” said Miss Lydgate " But how about the terms of 

the bequest ^ I mean, the glass cases ” 

“ Oh, blow the bequest * ” cned the Dean “ Surely one can hmow a 
thmg for a week or two We can lump some of those hideous geological 
specimens together and have one of the small cases taken up to your 
room.” 

By all means,” said Miss Edwards “ I’ll sec to it ” 
s «96 



“ Thank you,’^ said Hamet , “ that wdl be lovely ” 

** Aren’t you simply aching to play with the new toy ^ ” asked Miss 
Allison “ Does Lord Peter play chess ^ ” 

** I don’t know,” said Harriet “ I’m not much of a player I just fell 
in love with the pieces ” 

“ Well,” said Miss de Vine, kindly, let us have a game 'Fiiey are so 
beautiful, it would be a pity not to use them ” 

” But I expect you could play my head off ” 

“ Oh, do play with them * ” cned Mass Shaw, sentimentally “ Thinl 
how they must be longing for a little life and mo\ ement after sitting all 
that time in a shop window ” 

“ I will give you a pawn,” suggested Miss de Vine 
Even with this advantage, Harriet suffered three humilmtmg defeats 
m quick succession first, because she v^as but a poor player , secondly, 
because she found it difficult to remember which piece was which , 
thirdly, because the anguish of parting at one fell swoop with a fully- 
armed warrior, a prancing steed and a complete nest of ivory balls was 
such that she could scarcely bear to place so much as a pawn m jeopardv 
Miss de Vine, viewing with perfect equanimity the disappearance even 
of a robed counsellor with long moiAStaches oi an elephant carrying a 
castleful of combatants soon had Harriet’s Ling penned helplessly among 
his own defenders Nor was the game made any easier for the weaker 
party by being played under the aeusive eye of Miss Hiliyard, who, 
pronouncing chess to be the world’s most wearisome amusement, yet 
would not go away and get on with her work, but sat staring at the 
board as though fascinated and (what was worse) fiddling with the 
captured pieces and putting Harriet into an agony for fear she would 
drop one 

Moreover, when the games were finished, and Miss Edwards had 
announced that a glass case had been dusted and taken up to Harriet’s 
room by a scout, Miss Hiliyard insisted on helping to carry the pieces 
over, grasping for the purpose the white kmg and queen, waose headgear 
bore delicate waving ornaments like antennae, extremely liable to dam- 
age Even when the Dean had discovered that the pieces could be more 
safely transported standing upnght in their box, Mass Hiliyard attached 
herself to the party that escorted them across the quad, and w^as officious 
in helping to set the glass case in a convenient position opposite the bed, 
so that,” as she observed, “ you can see them if you w^ake up m the 
mght ” 

The following day happened to be the Dean’s birthday Hamet, 
going shortly after breakf^t to purchase a tnbute of roses in the Market, 
and coming out mto the High Street with the mtention of making an 
appointment at the hairdresser’s, was rewarded by the rather unexpected 
sight of two male backs, issumg from the Mitie and proceedmg, appar- 

10 * 297 



ently m perfect amit>j in an easterly direction The shorter and slighter 
of the two she could have singled out from a million backs anywhere , nor 
was It easy to mistake the towenng bulk and breadth of Mr Regmald 
Pomfret Both parties were smoking pipes, and she concluded from this 
that the object of their excursion could scarcely be swords or pistols on 
Port Meadow They weie strolling m a leisurely after-breakfast manner, 
and she took care not to catch them up She hoped that what Lord Saint- 
George called the ‘‘ famous family charm ” was being exerted to good 
purpose , she was too old to enjoy the sensation of being squabbled over— 
It made all three of them ridiculous Ten years ago, she might have felt 
flattered , bat it seemed that the lust to power was a thing one grew out 
of What one wanted, she thought, standing amid the stuffy perfumes of 
the hairdresser’s establishment, was peace, and freedom from the 
pressure of angry and agitated personalities She booked an appointment 
for the afternoon and resumed her way As she passed Queen’s, Peter 
came down the steps alone 

Hullo ^ ” said he “ Why the floral emblems ^ 

Harnet explained 

“ Good egg ’ ” said his lordship I like your Dean ” He relieved her 
of the roses “ Let me also be there with a gift 

Make her a goodly chapilet of azur’d Colombme, 

And wreathe about her coronet with sweetest Eglantine, 

With roses damask, white, and red, and fairest flower delice, 
With Gowshps of Jerusalem, and cloves of Paradice 

Though what Cowslips of Jerusalem may be I do not know, and they are 
probably not in season ” 

Harriet turned back with him marketwards 
** Your young friend came to see me,” pursued Peter 
** So I observed Did you ‘ fix a vacant stare and slay him with your 
noble birth ’ ^ ” 

** And he my own km m the sixteenth degree on the father’s mother’s 
side ^ No , he’s a mce lad, and the way to his heart is through the play- 
ing-fields of Eton He told me all his gnefs and I sympathised very kindly, 
mentionmg that there were better ways of killing care than drowmng it 
in a butt of malmsey But, O God, turn back the umverse and give me 
yesterday * He was beautifiiUy sozzled last mght, and had one breakfast 
before he came out and another with me at the Mitre I do not envy the 
heart of youth, but only its head and stomach ” 

'* Have you heard anythmg fresh about Arthur Robinson ^ ” 

** Only that he mamed a young woman called Charlotte Ann Clarke, 
and had by her a daughter, Beatrice Maud That was easy, because we 
know where he was living eight years ago, and could consult the local 
registers But they’re still hunting the registers to find either his death— 
supposmg him to be dead, which is rather less likdy than otherwise— or 



tlie birtii of the second child, which — it ever occurred — might tell wt 
where he went to after the trouble at York Unfo’tunately, Robinsons 
are as plentiful as blackberries, and Arthur Robinsons not uncommon 
And if he realiv did change his name, there may not be anv Robinson 
entries at all Another of my searchers has gone to his ofd lodgings — 
where, you may remember, he very imprudentl'v marned the landlady's 
daughter , but the Clarkes have moved, and it’s going to be a bit of a 
job finding them Another line is to inquire among the scholajsticagcnaes 
and the small and inferior pnvate schools, because it seems probable — 
You’re not attending ” 

“ Yes, I am,” said Harriet, \aguely “ He had a wife caUed Charlotte 
and you’re looking for him in a pnvate school ” A rich, damp fragrance 
gushed out upon them as they turned into the Market, and she was over- 
come by a sense of extravagant well-being “ I love this smell — it’s like 
the cactus-house in the Botamcal Gardens ” 

Her compamon opened his mouth to speak, looked at her, and then, 
as one that will not interfere with fortune, let the name of Robinson die 
upon his lips 

“ Mandragora dederunt odorem ” 

“ What do you say, Peter ^ ” 

** Nothing The words of Mercury are harsh after the songs of Apollo ” 
He laid his hand gently upon her arm Let us interview the merchant 
with the sops-m-wine ” 

And when both roses and carnations had been despatched—this time 
by a messenger — to their destmation, it seemed natural, since the 
Botamcal Gardens had been mentioned, to go there For a garden, as 
Bacon observes, is the purest of human pleasures and the gieatest refresh- 
ment to the spint of man , and even idle and ignorant people who cannot 
distinguish Leptosiphon hybndus from Kauljussia amellmdes and would rather 
languish away in a wilderness than break iheir backs with dibbling and 
weeding may get a good deal of pleasant conversation out of it, especially 
if they know the old-fashioned names of the commoner sorts of flowers 
and are both tolerably well acquainted with the mmor Elizabethan 
lyrists 

It was only when they had made the round of the Gardens and were 
sitting idly on the bank of the nver that Peter, wrenching his attention 
back to the sordid present, remarked suddenly 

I tbi-nk I shall have to pay a visit to a fnend of yours Do you know 
how Jukes came to be caught with the stuff on him ^ ” 

** Fve no idea ” 

“ The pohee got an anonymous letter ” 

« jsjo 7 

“ Yes One of them there By the way, did you ever try and find out 
what was to have been the last word of that message to you ^ The cue 
we found in the Science Lecture-Room ^ ” 


^99 



« No—she couldn’t have finished it, anyhow There wasn’t a single 
vowel left in the box Not even a B and a dash * ” 

“ That was an oveisight I thought so Well, Harriet, it’s easy to put a 
name to the person we want, isn’t it ^ But proof’s a different matter 
We’ve tied the thing up so tight That lecture-room episode was meant 
to be the last of the nocturnal prowls, and it probably will be. And the 
best bit of evidence will be at the bottom of the river by this time It’s too 
late to seal the doors and set a watch ” 

“ On whom ^ ” 

Surely you know by this time ^ You must know, Harriet, if you’re 
giving your mind to the thing at all Opportunity, means, motive— 
doesn’t it stand out a mile ^ For God’s sake, put your prejudices aside and 
think it out What’s happened to you that you can’t put two and two 
together ^ ” 

“ I don’t know ” 

** Well,” said he drily, “ if you really don’t know, it’s not for me to tell 
you But if you will turn your attention foi one moment to the matter in 

hand and go through your own dossier of the case carefully ” 

“ Undeterred by an casual sonnets I may find by the way ^ ” 

“ Undeterred by any personal consideration whatever,” he burst out, 
almost angrily “ No , you’re quite right That was a stupidity My 
talent for standing in my own light amounts to genius, doesn’t it ^ But 
when you have come to a conclusion about all this, will you remember 
that It was I who asked to take a dispassionate view and / who told 
you that of ail devils let loose m the world there was no devil like 
devoted love I don’t mean passion Passion’s a good, stupid horse 
that wiU pull the plough six days a week if you give him the run of his 
heels on Sundays But love’s a nervous, awkward, over-mastenng brute , 
if you can’t rein him, it’s best to have no truck with him ” 

“ That soimds very topsy-turvy,” said Harriet, mildly But his 
unwonted exatement had already &ckered out 
“ I’m only walking on my head, after the manner of clowns If we 
went along to Shrewsbury now, do you think the Warden would sec 


Later in the day, Dr Banng sent for Harriet 

“ Lord Peter Wimsey has been to see me,’* she said, with a rather 
cunous proposition which, after a little consideration, I refused He told 
me that he was almost certain m his own imnd of the identity of the — 
the offender, but that he was not in a position at the moment tex offer a 
complete proof He also said that the person had, he thought, taken the 
alarm, and would be doubly careful from now on to escape detection 
The alarm might, m fact, be suffiaent to prevent further outbreaks until 
the end of the term at any rate , but as soon as our vigilance was relaxed, 



the trouble would probably break out again in a more violent form I 
said that that would be very unsatisfactory^ and he agreed He asked 
whether he should name the person to mcj m order that a careful watch 
might be kept upon her movements I said I saw tw^o objections to that 
first, that the person might discover that she was being spied upon and 
merely mcrease her caution, and seconaly, that if he happened to be 
mistaken as to the offender’s identity, the person spied upon would be 
subjected to the most intolerable suspicions Supposing, I said, the perse- 
cutions merely ceased, and we were left suspectmg this person — ^who 
might be quite innocent — ^w^thout proof either wav He replied that 
those were precisely the objections that had occurred to him Do you 
know the name of the person to whom he alludes, ^'Iiss \^ane ? ” 

“ No,” said Harnet, who had been exercismg her vats m the mtcnral. 

‘‘ I am begmmng to have an idea , but I can’t make it fit In fact, I 
simply can’t believe it ” 

“ Very well Lord Peter then made a very remarkable proposition He 
asked whether I would allow him to interrogate this person privately, in 
the hope of surprising her into some admission He said that if this bluff, 
as he called it, came off, the culprit could then make her confession to me 
and be suffered to depart quietly, or be dealt with medically, as we 
might decide was advisable If, how'ever, it did not come off and the 
person demed everything, we might be placed in a very disagreeable 
position I rephed that I quite saw that, and could not possibly consent 
to have such methods used upon anybody m this College To which he 
rephed that that was exactly what he had expected me to say 

** I then asked him what evidence, if any, he had against this person 
He said that all his evidence was circumstantial , that he hoped to have 
more of it in the course of the next few days, but that in default of a fresh 
outbreak and the capture of the cuipnt r^-handed, he doubted whether 
any direct evidence could be produced at this stage I inqiured whether 
there was any reason why we should not at least wait for the production 
of the additional evidence ” 

Dr Banng paused and looked keenly at EEamet 
“ He rephed that there was only one reason, and that was that the 
cuipnt, instead of becoming more cautious, might throw caution to the 
winds and proceed to direct v’lolence ‘ In which case,* he said, ‘ we 
should very likely catch her, but only at the cost of somebody’s death or 
senous injury ’ I asked what persons were threatened with death or 
injury He said the most probable victims were- — ^yourself, Miss de Vine 
and another person whom he could not name, but whose existence, he 
said, he deduced He also surprised me by saying that an abortive attack 
had already been made upon you Is that true ^ ’* 

“ I shouldn’t have put it as strongly as that,” said Harnet She bneffy 
outlined the story of the telephone call At the name of Miss Hiliyard, the 
Warden looked up 

3031 



“ Do I understand that you entertain a definite suspicion of Miss 
Hillyard ^ 

** If I did/* said Harriet, cautiously “ I shouldn’t be the only person 
to do so But I’m bound to say that she doesn’t seem to fit in at ail with 
the line of Lord Peter’s mquuies, so far as I am acquainted with them ” 
I am glad to hear you say that,” replied Dr Baring “ Representa- 
tions have been made to me which — m default of evidence — I have been 
very unwilling to listen to ” 

So Dr Baring had kept abreast of the feeling in the SCR Miss 
Allison and Mrs Goodwin had probably been talking Well * 

“ In the end,” pursued the Warden, “ I informed Lord Peter tliat I 
thought it would be better to wait for the further evidence But that 
decision must, of course, be subject to the willingness of yourself and 
Miss de Vine to face the risks involved The willingness of the unknown 
third party cannot, naturally, be ascertained ” 

“ I don’t in the least mind what risks I take,” said Harriet “ But Miss 
de Vine ought to be warned, I suppose ” 

That is what I said Lord Peter agreed ” 

So, thought Harriet, something has decided him to acquit Miss de 
Vme I’m glad Unless this is a Macchiavelhan ruse to throw her off her 
guard 

“ Have you said anything to Miss de Vine, Warden ? ” 

** Miss de Vine is in Town, and will not return till to-morrow evemng. 
I propose to speak to her then 


So there was nothing to do but to wait And in the meantime, Harriet 
became aware of a cunous change m the atmosphere of the Semor 
Common Room It was as though they had lost sight of their mutual 
distrust and their general apprehensions and had drawn together hke 
spectators at the rmg-side to watch another kmd of conflict, m which 
she was one of the prmapals The curious tension thus produced was 
scarcely relieved by the Dean’s announcement to a few select spirits 
that in her opimon, Flaxman’s young man had given her the chuck and 
serve her right , to which Miss Flaxman’s tutor sourly replied that she 
wished people wouldn’t have these upheavals in the Summer Term, but 
that, fortunately. Miss Flaxman didn’t take her final Schools till next 
year This prompted Harriet to ask Miss Shaw how Miss Newland was 
getting on It appeared that Miss Newland was doing well, having 
completely got over the shock of her immersion m the Cherwell, so that 
her chances for a First looked pretty good 
*' Splendid * ” said Harriet ** I’ve car-marked my winnmgs already 
By the way, Miss Hillyard, how is our young friend Gattermoie ^ ” 

It seemed to her that die room waited breathlessly for the answer 
Miss Hillyard rephed, rather shortly, that Miss Gattermoie seemed to 
302 



have recovered such form as she had ever possessed, thanks, as she under- 
stood from the young woman herself, to Miss Vane^s good advice She 
added that it was very kind of Harriet amid he^* manv preoccuDations, 
to interest herself in the Histor>^ st«adents Harriet made some \ague 
replv and the room, as it seemed to her breatned aga n 

Later m the day, Haruet took an oatngger on tne er w'^th tne Dean, 
and, rather to her surprise, observed M^ss Cattermo.e ard Mr Pomfret 
sharing a punt Sne had received a pemtent letter- frorr Mr Pomfret, and 
waved a cneerful hand as the boats passec in ^oken peace restored 
If she had known that Mr Pomfret and Miss Cat^ermole had foand a 
bond of sympathy in devotion to herseif, she mignt have coecula^ed on 
what may happen to rejected lovers wno corfiae treir troub’es to wiJirg 
ears , but this did not occur to her, because she was wondering what, 
exactly, had happened that morning at tne Mitre and he” thoagnts had 
strayed away into the Botamcal Gardens before me Dean pointed out, 
rather sharply, that she was setting a very irreguiar and leisi^relv stroke 


It was Miss Shaw who innocently precipitated a fiare-up 
“ That’s a very handsome scarf, she said to ^Lss HilKard The dons 
were assembling, as usual, for Hall, outside the SCR, but the evening 
was dull and chilly and a thick siIj^ scarf was a grateful addition to 
evemng dress 

“ Yes,” said Miss Hillyard “ Unfortunatelv xi isn’t rune Some care- 
less person left it in the Fellows’ Garden last nign* and I rescued it I 
brought It along to be identified — but I’m reaav to admit that I can do 
with it this evemng ” 

“ I don’t know whose it can be,” said Miss Lvdgate She fingered it 
admiringly “It looks more hke a man s scarf,’ sne added 
Harriet, who had not been paying much attention, turned round, 
conscience-stricken 

“ Good lord * ” she said, “ that’s mine At least, it’s Pete’-’s I couldn’t 
think where I’d left it ” 

It was, m fact, €ie very scarf that had been used for a strangling 
demonstration on the Friday, and been brought back to Shrew snury by 
accident together with the chessmen and the dog-collar Mxss Hillyard 
turned bnck-red and snatched it off as though it were choking ner 
“ I beg your pardon, Miss Vane,” she said, holding it out 
" It’s all nght I don’t want it now But I m glad to know where it is 
I’d have got into trouble if I’d lost it.” 

“ Will you kindly take your property,” said Muss Hillyard 
Hamet, who was already wearing a scarf of her own, said 

“ Thank you But are you sure you won’t ” 

“ I will said Miss Hillyard, dropping the scarf angnly on the 
steps. 


303 



** Dear me > ” said the Dean, picbng it up “ Nobody seems to want 
this mce scarf I shall borrow it I call it a nasty, chilly evemng, and I 
don’t know why we can’t all go inside ” 

She twisted the scarf comfortably round her neck and, the Warden 
mercifully arnving at that moment, they went in to dinner 


At a quarter to ten, Harriet, after an hour or so spent with Miss Lyd- 
gate on her proofs — now actually nearing the stage when they might 
really be sent to the printer — crossed the Old Quad to Tudor Building 
On the steps, just coming out, she met Miss Hillyard 
“ Were you looking for me ^ ” asked Harriet, a little aggressively 
“ No,” said Miss Hillyard, “ I wasn’t Certainly not ” She spoke 
hurriedly, and Harriet fanaed that there was something in her eyes 
both furtive and malicious , but the evemng was dark for the middle of 
May, and she could not be sure 
“ Oh ’ ” said Harriet “ I thought you might be ” 

“ Well, I wasn’t,” said Miss Hillyard again And as Harriet passed 
her she turned back and said, almost as though the words were forced out 
of her 

Going to work — ^under the inspiration of your beautiful chessmen ^ ” 
“ More or less,” said Harnet, laughing 
“ I hope you will have a pleasant evening,” said Miss Hillyard 
Harnet went on upstairs and opened the door of her room 
The glass case had been shattered, and the floor was strewn with 
broken glass and with smashed and trampled fragments of red and white 
ivory 

For about five minutes, Harnet was the prey of that kind of speechless 
rage which is beyond expression or control If she had thought of it, she 
was at that moment m a mood to sympathise with the Poltergeist and all 
her works If she could have beaten or strangled anybody, she would 
have done it and felt the better for it Happily, after the first devastating 
fury, she found the relief of bad language When she found she could keep 
her voice steady, she locked her bedroom door behind her and went down 
to the telephone. 


Even so, she was at first so incoherent that Peter could hardly under- 
stand what she said When he did understand, he was maddemngly cool 
about It, merely asking whether she had touched anything or told any- 
body When assured that she had not, he rephed cheerfully that he would 
be along m a few minutes 

Harriet went out and raged distractedly about the New Quad till she 
heard him nng— for the gates were now shut — and only a last lingering 

304 



vestige of self-restraint prevented her from rushing at him and pouring 
out her indignation in the presence of Padgett But she waited for ium in 
the middle of the quad 
Peter — oh Peter * ” 

“ Well,” said he, “ this is lather encouraging I uas afiaid we might 
hav e choked off these demonstrations for good and all ” 

“ But mv chessmen ’ I could kill her for that ” 

“ My dear, it*s sickening that il should be your chessmen But don’t 
let’s lose all sense of proportion It might ha\e been yoa ” 

“ I wish It had been I could have hit back ” 

** Termagant Let’s go and look at the aamage ” 

“ It’s hornble, Peter It’s like a massacre It’s — it’s rather fnghtenirg, 
somehow — they’ve been hit so hard ” 

When he saw the room, Wmisey looked grave enough 
Yes,” he said, kneeling amid the wreckage “ Blind, bestial mahg- 
mty Not only broken but ground to powder There’s been a heel at work 
here, as well as the poker , you can see the marks on the carpet She 
hates you, Harriet I didn’t realise that I thought she was oniv afraid of 
you Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul ^ Look * 
one poor warrior iudmg behind the coal-scuttle — remnant of a mighty 
army ” 

He held up the solitary red pawn, smiimg , and then scrambled 
hurriedly to his feet 

“ My dear girl, don’t cry about it What the hell does it matter ^ ” 

“ I loved them,” said Harriet, ** and >ou ga\e them to me ” 

He shook his head 

“ It’s a pity It’s that way round ‘ You gave them to me, and I ioved 
them ’ IS all right, but, ® I loved them and you gave them to me ’ is 
irreparable Fifty thousand rocs’ eggs won’t supply their place ‘ The 
virgin’s gone and I am gone , she’s gone, she’s gone and what shall I 
do ^ ’ But you needn’t weep over the chest of drawers while I have a 
shoulder at your disposal, need you ^ ” 

** I’m sorry I’m bemg a perfect idiot ” 

“ I told you love was the devil and all Two-and-thirty chessmen, 
baked m a pie ‘ And all the powerful kings and all the beautiful queens 
of this world were but as a bed of flowers * ” 

“ I might have had the decency to take care of them ” 

That’s foolish,” said he, with his mouth mufffed in her hair ” Don’t 
talk so soft, or I shall get foohsh too Listen When did ail this happen ^ ” 
“ Between Hall and a quarter to ten ” 

** Was anybody absent from Hall ^ Becai^e this must have made a hit 
of a noise After Hall, there’d be students about, who mighty hear the 
glass smash or notice if anybody mmsuai was wandering about ” 

“ There might be students here all through Hall — they often have eggs 
in their rooms And— good God ’—there was somebody unusual— She 

305 



said something about the chessmeOj too And she was queer about them 
last night 

“ Who was that ? ” 

“ Miss Hiliyard ” 

** Again * ” 

While Harriet told her story he fidgeted restlessly about the room, 
avoiding the broken glass and ivory on the floor with the automatic 
precision of a cat, and stood at length in the window with his back to her 
She had drawn the curtains together when she had brought him up, and 
his gaze at them seemed puiely preoccupied 

Hell * ” he said, presently “ That’s a devil of a complication ” He 
still had the red pawn in his hand, and he now came back, and set it with 
great precision in the centre of the mantelpiece “ Yes Well, I suppose 
you’ll have to find out ” 

Somebody knocked at the door, and Harriet went to open it 
“ Excuse me, madam, but Padgett sent over to the Semor Common 
Room to see if Lord Peter Wmisey was there, and seeing he thought you 
might know ” 

“ He’s here, Anme It’s for you, Peter ” 

“ Yes ^ ” said Peter, coming to the door 

“ If you please, sir, they’ve rung up from the Mitre to say there’s a 
message come from the Foreign Office and would you kindly rmg up at 
once ” 

“ What ^ Oh, lord, that would happen > Very well, thank you, Annie 
Oh, one moment Was it you who saw the — er — the person who was 
playing tncks in the Lecture-Room ^ ” 

** Yes, sir Not to know her again, sir ” 

“ No , but you did see her, and she may not know you couldn’t recog- 
nise her I think if I were you I’d be rather careful how you go about the 
College after dark I don’t want to frighten you, but you see wnat’s 
happened to Miss Vane’s chessmen ^ ” 

“ Yes, I see, sir What a pity, isn’t it ^ ” 

“ It would be more than a pity if anything unpleasant happened to you 
personally Now, don’t get the wind up — but if I were you, I’d take 
somebody with me when I went out after sunset And I should give the 
same advice to the scout who was with you ” 

« To Came ? Very weU, I’ll tell her ” 

“ It’s only a precaution, >ou know Good mght, Anme ” 

Gk>od night, sir Thank you ” 

I shall have to make quite an issue of dog-collars,” said Peter “ You 
never know whether to warn people or not Some of them get hysterics, 
but she looks fairly level-headed Look here, my dear, tins is all very 
tiresome If it’s another summons to Rome, I shall have to go (I should 
lock that door ) Needs must when duty calls, and all that If it is Rome, 
I’ll tell Bunter to brmg round ail the notes I’ve got at the Mitre and 
So6 



instruct Miss Glimpson’s sieuths to report direct to you In any case, I’ll 
ring you up this evening as soon as I know what it*s all about. If it isn*t 
Rome, Fii come round again m the mormng And in the meantime, 
don’t let anvbody into your room I think I’d lock it up and sleep 
elsewhere to-mght ” 

“ I thought )ou didn’t expect any moie right distUibances ” 

I don’t , but I don’t want people walking o\er that floor ” He 
stopped on the staircase to examine the soles of his shoes “ I haven’t 
earned away any bits Do you think you have ^ ” 

Harriet stood first on one leg and then another 
Not this time And the £rst time I didn’t walk into the mess at ail 
I stood in the doorway and swore ” 

‘‘ Good girl The patiis m the quad are a bit damp vou know% and 
something might have stuck As a matter of fact, it’s rammg a little now 
You’ll get w'et ” 

It doesn’t matter Oh, Peter ^ I’ve got that w'hite scarf of yours ” 

“ Keep It till I come again — which will be to-morrow^, with luck, and 
otherwise, God knows when Damn it * I knew^ there was trouble 
coming ” He stood still under the beech-tiees “ Harriet, don’t choose 
the moment my back’s turned to get yourself W'lped out or anything — not 
if you can help it , I mean, you’re not very good at looking after 
valuables ” 

“ I nught have the decency to take care ^ Ail nght, Peter I’ll do my 
best this time Word of honour ” 

She gave him her hand and he kissed it Once again Harriet thought 
she saw somebody move m the darkness, as on the last occasion they had 
walked through the shadowy quads But she dared not delay him and 
so again said nothing Padgett let him out through the gate and Harnet, 
turning away, foimd herself face to face w^th h-Iiss HiUyard 
Miss Vane, I should like to speak to you ” 

“ Certainly,” said Hamet, “ I should rather like to speak to you J* 
Miss Hiliyard, without another word, led the way to her own rooms 
Harriet followed her up the stairs and mto the sitting-room. The tutor’s 
face was very white as she shut the door after them and said, WTithout 
asking Harriet to sit down 

** Miss Vane What are the relations between that man and you ^ ” 

“ What do you mean by that ^ ” 

“ You know perfectly well what I mean If nobody else will speak to 
you about your behaviour, I must You bring the man here, knowing 

perfectly well what his reputation is ” 

“ I know what his reputation as a detective is ” 

** I mean his moral reputation You know as well as I do that he m 

notonous all over Europe He keeps w’^omen by the score ” 

All at once or in succession ^ ” 

“ It’s no use bemg impertment I suppose that to a person with your 

307 



past history, that kind of thing is merely amusing But you must try to 
conduct yourself with a little more decency The way you look at him is 
a disgrace You pretend to be the merest acquaintance of his and call 
him by his title in public and his Christian name in private You take 

him up to your room at mght ” 

“ Really, Miss Hillyard, I can’t allow ” 

** Fve seen you Twice He was there to-mght You let him kiss your 

hands and make love to you ” 

“ So that was you, spying about under the beeches ” 

** How dare you use such a word ^ ” 

How dare you say such a thing ^ ” 

** It’s no affair of mine how you behave in Bloomsbury But if you 
bnng your lovers here ” 

** You know very well that he is not my lover And you know very well 
why he came to my room lo-mght ” 

“ I can guess ” 

And I know very well 'whyjfou came there ” 

I came there ^ I don’t know what you mean ” 

You do And you know that he came to see the damage you did m 
my room ” 

** I never went into your room ” 

** You didn’t go into my room and smash up my chessmen ^ ” 

Miss Hillyard’s dark eyes flickered 

** Certainly I did not I told you I hadn’t been anywhere near your 
room to-mght ” 

“ Then,” aiiid Harriet, “ you told a lie ” 

She was too angry to be lightened, though it did cross her mind that 
if the furious white-faced woman attacked her, it might be difficult to 
summon assistance on this isolated staircase, and she thought of the dog- 
collar 

“ I know It’s a he,” said Harriet, “ because there’s a piece of broken 
ivory on the carpet under your writmg-table and another stuck on the 
heel of your nght shoe, I saw it, commg upstairs.” 

She was prepared for anything after that, but to her surpnse. Miss 
Hillyard staggered a little, sat down suddenly, and said, Oh, My 
God » ” 

“ If you had nothing to do with smashing those chessmen,” went on 
Hamet, “ or with the other pranks that have been played m this College, 
you’d better cxplam those pieces of ivory ” 

(Am I a fool, she thought, showing my hand like this ^ But if I didn’t, 
what would become of the evidence ^ ) 

Miss Hillyard, in a bewildered way, pulled off her slipper and looked 
at the sliver of white that clung to the heel, embedded in a little patch of 
damp gravel 

** Give It to me,” said Harriet, and took shpper and all. 

308 



She had esEpected an outburst of denial, but Miss HiHyard said^ 
faintly 

“ That’s evidence incontrovertible • • ” 

Harriet thanked Heaven, with grim amusement, for the scholarly 
habit , at least, one did not have to argue about what was or was not 
evidence 

“ I did go into your room I went there to say to you Vkhat I said just 
now But you weren’t there And when I saw the mess on the floor I 
thought — I was afraid you’d think ” 

“I did think” 

« What did he think?” 

“ Lord Peter ? I don’t know what he thought But he’ll probably 
think something now ” 

“ You’ve no evidence that I did it,” said Miss Hillyard, with sudden 
spmt ** Only that I was in the room It was done when I got there 
I saw it, I went to look at it You can tell vour lover that I saw it and 
was glad to see it But he’ll tell you that’s no proof that I did it ” 

“ Look here, Miss Hillyard,” said Harriet, divided between anger, 
suspicion and a dreadful kind of pity, “ you must understand, once and 
for all, that he is not my lover Do you really imagine that if he were, 

we should ” here her sense of the ludicrous overcame her and made 

It difficult to control her voice — we should come and misbehave our- 
selves in the greatest possible discomfort at Shrewsbury ? Even if I had 
no respect for the College — ^where would be the point of it ? With all 
the world and all the time there is at our disposal, why on earth should 
we come and play the fool down here ^ It would be silly And if you 
really were down there in the quad just now, you must know that 
people who are lovers don’t treat each other hke that At least,” she 
added rather unkindly, “ if you knew anything about it at all, you’d 
know that We’re very old friends, and I owe him a great deal ” 

“ Don’t talk nonsense,” said the tutor roughly You know you’re in 
love with the man ” 

“ By God * ” said Harriet, suddenly cnhghtencd, “ if I’m not, I know 
who IS ” 

“ You’ve no right to say that • ” 

“ It’s true, all the same,” said Harnet ‘‘ Oh, damn * I suppose it’s 
no good my saymg I’m frightfully sorry” (Dynamite m a powder 
factory^ Yes, indeed, Miss Edwards you saw it before anybody else. 
Biologically interestmg 0 This kmd of thing is the devil and alL” 
(“ That’s the devil of a comphcation,” Peter had said He’d seen it, 
of course Must have Too much experience not to Probably happened 
scores of times— scores of women — all over Europe Oh, dear * Oh, dear ! 
And was that a random accusation, or had Miss Hiliyard been delving 
into the past and digging up Viennese singers ?) 

“ For Heaven’s sake,” said Miss Hillyard, “ go away » ” 

S09 



“ I think I’d better,” said Hainet 

She did not know how to deal with the situation at all She could 
no longer feel outraged or angry She was not alarmed She was not 
jealous She was only sorry, and quite incapable of expressing any 
sympathy which would not be an insult She realised that she was still 
clutching Miss Hillyard’s shpper Had she better give it back ^ It was 
evidence — of something But of what^ The whole business of the 
Poltergeist seemed to have retreated over the horizon, leaving behind 
It the tormented shell of a woman staring blindly into vacancy under 
the cruel harshness of the electric light Harriet picked up the other 
fragment of ivory from under the writing-table — the little spearhead 
from a red pawn 

Well, whatever one’s personal feelings, evidence was evidence Peter 
— she remembered that Peter had said he would ring up from the 
Mitre She went downstairs with the slipper in her hand, and in the 
New Quad ran into Mrs Padgett, who was just coming to look for her 
The call was switched through to the box in Queen Ehzabeth 
“ It’s not so bad after all,” said Peter’s voice, “ It’s only the Grand 
Panjandrum wanting a conference at his private house Sort of Pleasant 
Sunday Afternoon in Wild Warwickshire It may mean London or 
Rome after that, but we’ll hope not At any rate, it’ll do if I’m there 
by half-past eleven, so I’ll pop round and see you about nine ” 

“ Please do Something’s happened Not alarming, but upsetting I 
can’t tell you on the ’phone ” 

He again promised to come, and said good night Harriet, after 
locking the slipper and the piece of ivory carefully away, went to the 
Bursar, and was accommodated with a bed m the Infirmary

EDMUND SPENSER 

Harriet left word at the Lodge that she would wait for Lord Peter 
Wimscy m the Fellows’ Garden She had breakfasted early, thus avoid- 
310 



mg Miss Hiliyard, who passed through the New Qpad hke an angry 
shadow while she was talking to Padgett 
She had first met Peter at a moment when every physical feeling had 
been battered out of her by the brutahty of circumstance , by this 
accident she had been aware of him from the beginning as a mind and 
spirit localised m a body Never — not even m those later dizzying 
moments on the river — bad she considered him pnmanly as a male 
animal, or calculated the promise implicit in the veiled eyes, tne long, 
flexible mouth, the curiously vital hands Nor, since of her he had 
always asked and never demanded, had she felt in him any domination 
but that of intellect But now, as he advanced towards her along the 
flower-bordered path, she saw him with new ey^cs — the eyes of women 
who had seen him before they knew him — saw him, as tliey saw him, 
dynamically Miss Hillyard, Miss Edwards, Miss de Vine, the Dean 
even, each in her own way had recogmsed the same thing six cen- 
turies of possessiveness, fastened under the yoke of urbanity She her- 
self, seeing it impudent and uncontrolled m the nephew, had known 
It instantly for what it was , it astonished her that in the older man she 
should have been blind to it so long and should still retain so strong a 
defence against it And she wondered whether it w^as only accident that 
had sealed her eves till it was too late for realisation to bring disaster 

She sat still where she was till he stood loomng down at her 

“ Well ^ ” he said, lightly, “ how doth my lady ^ What, sweeting, 
all amort ^ Yes, something has happened , I see it has What is 
It, domina ” 

Though the tone was half-jesting, nothing could have reassured her 
like that grave, academic title She said, as though she were reciting a 
lesson 

“ When you left last mght, Miss Hillyard met me in the New Quad 
She asked me to come up to her room because she wanted to speak 
to me On the w^ay up, I saw there was a little piece of white ivory 
stuck on the heel of her slipper She — ^made some rather unpleasant 
accusations , she had misunderstood the position ” 

“ That can and shall be put right Did you say anything about the 
slipper ^ ” 

“ Pm afraid I did There was another bit of Ivor)’’ on the floor I 
accused her of having gone into my room, and she denied it till I 
showed her the evidence Then she admitted it , but she said the damage 
was already done when she got there ” 

Did you beheve her ^ 

“ I might have done if , if she hadn^t shown me a motive ** 

** I see All right You needn’^t tell me ” 

She looked up for the first time into a face as bleak as winter, and 
faltered 

“ I brought the shpper away with me I wash I hadn’t ” 



“ Are you going to be afraid of the facts ^ ” he said ** And you a 
scholar ^ 

“ I don’t think I did it in malice I hope not But I was bitterly 
unkind to her ” 

Happily/’ said he, a fact is a fact, and your state of mind won’t 
alter it by a haii’s breadth Let’s go now and have the truth at all 
hazards ” 

She led him up to her room, where the morning sun cast a long 
rectangle of brilliance across the rum on the floor From the chest near 
the door she took out the slipper and handed it to him He lay down 
flat, squinting sideways along the carpet in the place where neither he 
nor she had trodden the night before His hand went to his pocket, 
and he smiled up sideways into her troubled face 
“ If all the pens that ever poets held had had the feeling of their 
masters’ thoughts, they could not write as much solid fact as you can 
hold in a pair of callipers ” He measured the heel of the slipper in both 
diicctions, and then turned his attention to the pile of the carpet 
‘‘ She stood here, heels together, looking ” The callipers twinkled over 
the sunlit rectangle “ And here is the heel that stamped and trampled 
and ground beauty to dust One was a French heel and one was a 
Cuban heel — isn’t that what the footwear specialists call them ^ ” He 
sat up and tapped the sole of the slipper lightly with the callipers 
“ Who goes there ^ France — Pass, France, and all’s well ” 

“ Oh, I’m glad,” said Harriet, fervently “ I’m glad ” 

** Yes Meanness isn’t one of your accomplishments, is it ^ ” He 
turned his eyes to the carpet again, this time to a place near the edge 
** Look ’ now that the sun’s out you can see it Here’s where Cuban 
Heel wiped her soles before she left There are very few flies on Cuban 
Heel Well, that saves us a back-breaking search all over the College 
for the dust of kings and queens ” He picked the sliver of ivory from 
the French heel, put the slipper in his pocket and stood up “ This had 
better go back to its owner, fiirmshed with a certificate of innocence ” 

“ Give it to me I must take it ” 

** No, you will not If anybody has to face unpleasantness, it shan’t 
be you this time ” 

** But Peter— you won’t ” 

“ No,” he said, “ I won’t Trust me for that ” 

Hamet was left starmg at the broken chessmen Presently she went 
out into the comdor, found a dustpan and brush in a scout’s pantry 
and returned with them to sweep up the debris As she was replacing 
the brush and pan m the pantry, she ran into one oi the students from 
the annexe 

By the way, Miss Swift,” said Harriet, “ you didn’t happen to hear 
any noise m my room hke glass being smashed last mght did you ^ 
Some time durmg or after Hall ^ ” 

312 



** No, I didn’t, Mtss Vane I was m my own room ail evening But 
wait a moment Miss Ward came along about haif-past nme to do some 
Morphology with me and” — the girl’s mouth dimpled into laughter 
— “ she asked if you w^ere a secret toffee-eater, because it sounded as 
though you were smashing up toffee wnth the poker Has the College 
Ghost been visiting you ^ ” 

“ I’m afraid so,” said Harriet “ Thank you , that’s very helpful I 
must see Miss Ward ” 

Miss Ward, however, could help no farther than by fixing the 
time a httle more definitely as “ certainlv not later than half-past 
nine ” 

Harriet thanked her, and went out Her very bones seemed to ache 
with restlessness — or perhaps it was with having slept badly in an 
unfamihar bed and with a disturbed mmd The sun had scattered 
diamonds among the wet grass of the quadrangle, and the breeze was 
shaking the ram in a hea^’v spatter of drops from the beeches Students 
came and went Somebody had left a scarlet cushion out all mght m 
the ram , it was sodden and mournful-looking , its owner came and 
picked it up, with an air between laughter and disgust , she threw it 
on a bench to dry in the sunshine 

To do nothing was intolerable To be spoken to by any member of 
the Semor Common Room would be still more intolerable She was 
penned in the Old Qpad, for she was sensitive to the mere neighbourhood 
of the New Qiiad as a person that has been vaccinated is sensitive to 
everything that lies on the sore side of his body Without particular 
aim or intention, she skirted the tennis-court and turned in at the 
Library entrance She had intended to go upstairs but, seeing the door 
of Miss de Vine’s set stand open, she altered her naind , she could 
borrow a book from there The little lobby was empty, but in the sitting- 
room a scout was giving the wnting-tabie a Surday-monung flick with 
the duster Hariiet remembered that Miss dc Vine was in Town, and 
that she was to be warned when she returned 

“ What time docs Miss dc Vine get back to-night ^ Do you know, 
NeUie ? ” 

“ I think she gets m by the 9 39, miss ” 

Hamet nodded, took a book from the shelves at random, and went 
to sit on the steps of the loggia, where there was a deck-chair The 
mormng, she told herself, was getting on If Peter had to get to his 
destination by 1 1 30, it was time he went She vividly remembered 
waiting in a nursing-home while a friend underwent an operation , 
there had been a smell of ether, and, in the w^aitmg-room, a large 
black Wedgwood jar, filled with delphimums 

She read a page without knowing what was in it, and looked up at 
an approaching footstep into the face of Miss Hillyard 

Lord Peter,” said Miss Hillyard, without preface, “ asked me to give 

313 



you this address He was obliged to leave quickly to keep his appoint- 
ment ” 

Harriet took the paper and said, ** Thank you ” 

Miss Hillyard went on resolutely “ When I spoke to you last mght 
I was under a misapprehension I had not fully realised the difficulty 
of your position I am afraid I have unwittingly made it harder for 
you, and I apologise ” 

“ That’s all right,” said Harriet, taking refuge in formula “ I am 
sorry too I was rather upset last mght and said a great deal moie than 
I should This wretched business has made everything so uncom- 
fortable ” 

“ Indeed it has,” said Miss Hillyard, in a more natural voice ** We 
are all feeling rather overwrought I wish we could get at the truth of 
It I understand that you now accept my account of my movements 
last mght ” 

** Absolutely It was inexcusable of me not to have verified my data ” 
“ Appearances can be very noisleading,” said Miss Hillyard 
There was a pause 

“ Well,” said Harnet at last, “ I hope we may forget all this ” She 
knew as she spoke that one thing at least had been said which could 
never be forgotten she would have given a great deal to recall it 
“ I shall do my best,” replied Miss Hillyard “ Perhaps I am too 
much inclined to judge harshly of matters outside my experience ” 

** It IS very kind of you to say that,” said Harriet Please beheve 
that I don’t take a very self-satisfied view of myself either ” 

“ Very likely not I have noticed that the people who get opportuni- 
ties always seem to choose the wrong ones But it’s no affair of mine 
Good morning ” 

She went as abruptly as she had come Harriet glanced at the book 
on her knee and discovered that she was reading The Anatomy of 
Melancholy 

“ Fleat Heraclitus an ndeat Democritus ^ m attempting to speak of these 
Symptoms, shall I laugh with Democritus or weep with Heraclitus ^ they 
are so ridiculous and absurd on the one side, so lamentable and tragical 
on the other ” 

Harriet got the car out m the afternoon and took Miss Lydgate and 
the Dean for a picnic m the neighbourhood of Hinksey When she got 
back, in time for supper, she found an urgent message at the Lodge, 
asking her to nng up Lord Samt-George at the House as soon as she 
got back His voice, when he answered the call, soxmded agitated 

Oh, look here 1 1 can’t get hold of Uncle Peter — ^he’s vanished again, 
curse him * I say, I saw your ghost this afternoon, and I do think you 
ought to be careful ” 

“ Where did you see her ? When ^ ” 

314 



“ About half-past two — wallang over Magdalen Badge m broad day- 
light Fd been lunching with some chaps out Iffley way and we were 
just pulling over to put one of *em down at Magdalenj when I spotted 
her She was walking along, muttenrg to herself, and looL-ng awfahy 
queer Soit of clutching with her hands and rolling her eyes about She 
spotted me, too Couldn’t mistake hei A friend of mine was dtiVing 
and I tried to catcii his attention, but he was pulling round behind a 
bus and I couldn’t make him understand Anvhow, when we stopped 
at Magdalen gate, I hopped out and ran back, but I couldn’t ^nd her 
anywhere Seemed to have faded out I bet she Lnew^ I was on to her 
and made tracks I was scared Thought she looked up to anything. 
So I rang up your place and found you were out and then I rang up 
the Mitre and that wasn’t any good either, so V\ e been sitting here all 
evemng in a devil of a stev^ First I tnought Fd leave a note, and then 
I thought Fd better tell you mvself Rather demoted of me, don’t >ou 
think I cut a supper-party so as not to miss you ” 

“ That was frightfully kind of you,” said Harriet “ What was the 
ghost dressed in ^ ” 

“ Oh — one of those sort of dark-blue frocks with spnggy bits on it 
and a hat with a bnm Sort of thing most of your dons wear m the 
afternoon Neat, not gaudy Not smart Jr^t ordinary It was the eyes 
I recognised Made me feel all goose-fiesh Honest That woman's not 
safe, I’ll swear she isn’t ” 

“ It’s very good of you to warn me,” said Harnet again FlI try 
and find out who it could have been And I’ll take precautions ” 

“ Please do,” said Lord Saint-George I mean, Uncle Peter’s getting 
the wmd up horribly Gone clean off his oats Of course I know he’s a 
fidgety old ass and I’ve been doing my best to soothe the troubled 
breast and all that, but I’m beginning to think he’s got some excuse 
For goodness’ sake, Aunt Hainet, do something about it I can’t afford 
to have a valuable uncle destroyed under my eyes He’s getting like the 
Lord of Burleigh, you know — walkmg up and pacing down and so on 
— and tlie responsibility is very wearing ” 

I’ll teU you what,” said Harriet You’d better come and dine in 
College to-morrow and see if you can spot the lady It’s no good this 
evemng, because so many people don’t turn up to Sunday supper ” 

“ Right-ho » ” said the viscount “ That’s a dashed good idea Fd 
get a dashed good birthday-present out of Unde Peter if I solved his 
problem for him So long and take care of yourself ” 

“ I ought to have thought of that before,” said Harnet, retailing this 
piece of news to the Dean , “ but I never imagined he’d recognise the 
woman like that after only seeing her once ” 

The Dean, to whom the whole story of Lord Samt-George’s ghostly 
encounter had come as a novelty, was inclined to be sceptical “ Person^ 

315 



ally, I wouldn’t undertake to identify anybody after one glimpse in the 
dark— and I certainly wouldn’t trust a young harum-scarum like that 
The only person here I know of with a navy sprigged foulard is Miss 
Lydgate, and I absolutely refuse to believe that ' But ask the young m^n 
to dinner by all means I’m all for excitement, and he’s even more 
ornamental than the other one ” 

It was borne in upon Karnet that things were coming to a crisis 
“ Take precautions ” A mcc fool she would look, going about with a 
dog-collar round her neck Nor would it be any defence against pokers 
and such things The wind must be in the south-west, for the 
heavy boom of Tom tolbng his hundred-and-one came clearly to her 
cars as she crossed the Old Qjiad 

“ Not later than half-past mne,” Miss Ward had said If the peril had 
ceased to walk by mght, it was still abroad of an evemng 

She went upstairs and locked the door of her room before opemng a 
drawer and taking out the heavy strap of brass and leather There was 
something about the description of that woman walking wild-eyed over 
Magdalen Bridge and “ clutclung with her hands ” that was very 
unpleasant to think of She could feel Peter’s grip on her throat now like 
a band of iron, and could hear him saying serenely, like a text-book 

“ That IS the dangerous spot Compression of the big blood-vessels 
there will cause almost instant unconsciousness And then, you see, 
you’re done for ” 

And at the momentary pressure of his thumbs the fire had swum in 
her eyes 

She turned with a start as something rattled the door-handle Prob- 
ably the passage window was open and the wind blowing m She was 
getting ridiculously nervous 

The buckle was stiff to her fingers (Is thy servant a dog that she 
should do this thing When she saw herself in the glass, she laughed 
“ An arum -lily quality that is in itself an invitation to violence ” Her 
own face, m the drowned evenmg light, surprised her — ^softened and 
startled and drained of colour, with eyes that looked unnaturally large 
under the heavy black brows, and lips a little parted It was like the 
head of someone who had been guillotined , the dark band cut it off 
from the body like the stroke of the headsman’s steel 

She wondered whether her lover had seen it like that, through that 
hot unhappy year when she had tned to beheve that there was happi- 
ness m surrender Poor Philip — ^tormented by his own vamtxes, never 
loving her till he had killed her feeling for him, and yet perilously 
clutching her as he went down into the slough of death It was not to 
Philip she had submitted, so much as to a theory of living The young 
were always theoretical , only the middle-aged could realise the dead- 
lincss of pnnaples To subdue one’s self to one’s own ends naight be 
dangerous, but to subdue one’s self to other people’s ^ds was dust and 
316 



ashes Yet there were those, stiil more unliappy, who emnud even the 
ashy saltness of those dead sea apples. 

Gould there ever be any alliance between the intellect and the flesh ^ 
It was this business of asLmg questions and anah-smg everything that 
stenlised and stultified all one’s passions Experience perhaps had a 
formula to get over this diSicult)” one kept the bitter, tormenting 
brain on one side of the wall and the languorous sweet body on the 
other, and never let tliem meet So that if you were made that way, 
you could argue about loyalties in an Oxford common-room and 
refresh yourself elsewhere with — say — ^Viennese smgers, presentmg an 
unruffled surface on both sides of yourself Easy for a man, and possible 
even for a woman, if one avoided foolish accidents like being tried for 
murder But to seek to force incompatibics into a compromise was 
madness , one should neither do xt nor be a party to it If Peter wanted 
to make the experiment, he must do it without Harnet's conmvance 
Six centuries of possessive blood would not be dictated to bv a bare 
forty-five years of over-sensitiscd intellect Let the male animal tale the 
female and be content , the busy bram could very weU be “ left talk- 
ing ” like the hero of Man and Supeinian In a long monologue, of course , 
for the female animal could only listen witliout contnbutmg Other- 
wise one would get the sort of couple one had in Private LtteSi who 
rolled on the floor and hammered one another when they weren’t 
making love, because they (obviously) had no conversational resources 
A vista of crashing boredom, either v^ay 

The door rattled again, as a reminder that even a little boredom 
might be welcome by way of change from alarms On the mantelpiece, 
a solitary red pawn mocked all security How quietly Anme had 
taken Peter’s warmng Did she take it senously ^ Was she looking after 
herself^ She had been her usual refined and self-conta*ned self when she 
brought m the Common-room coffee that mght — ^perhaps a little 
brighter looking than usual Of course, she had had her afternoon off 
with Beatie and Carola Curious, thought Harriet, this desire to 
possess children and dictate their tastes, as though they were escaping 
fragments of one’s self, and not separate individuals Even if the taste 
ran to motor-bikes Annie was all nght How about Miss de Vine, 
travelling down from Town in happy ignorance ^ — ^With a start, Harriet 
saw that it was nearly a quarter to ten The train must be in Had the 
Warden remembered about warning Miss de Vine ^ She ought not to 
be left to sleep in that ground-floor room without being forearmed 
But the Warden never forgot anything 
Nevertheless, Harriet was uneasy From her window she could not 
see whether any lights were on in the Library Wmg She unlocked the 
door and stepped out (yes—the passage wmdow was open , nobody but 
the wind had rattled the handle). A few dim figures were still moxing 
at the far end of the quad as she passed along beside the tenms- court 

3^7 



In the Library Wmg, all the ground-floor windows were dark e3jcept 
for the dim glow of the passage-light Miss Barton, at any rate, was not 
in her room , nor was Miss de Vine back yet Or — yes, she must be j 
for the window-cui tains were drawn in her sitting-room, though no 
hght shone as yet behind them 

Harriet went into the building The door of Miss Bunows’ set stood 
open, and the lobby was dark Miss de Vine’s door was shut She 
knocked, but there was no answer — and it suddenly struck her as odd 
that the curtains should be drawn and no light on She opened the 
docw: and pressed down the wall switch in the lobby Nothing happened 
With a growing sense of disquiet, she went on to the sitting-room door 
and opened that ^\nd then, as her fingers went out to the switch, the 
fierce dutch took her by the throat 

She had two advantages , she was partly prepared, and the assailant 
had not expected the dog-collar She felt and heard the qmck gasp in 
her face as the strong, cruel fingers fumbled on the stiff leather As they 
shifted their hold, she had time to remember what she had been taught 
— to catch and jerk the wrists apart But as her feet felt for the other’s 
feet, her high heels slipped on the parquet — and she was falling — they 
were falling together and she was undermost , they seemed to take years 
to fall , and all the time a stream of hoarse, filthy abuse was running 
into her cars Then the world went black in fire and thunder 

Faces — swimming confusedly through crackling waves of pain — 
swelling and diminishing anxiously — then resolving themselves into one 
— ^Miss Hillyard’s face, enormous and close to her own Then a voice, 
agomsingly loud, blanng umntelligiblv like a fog-horn Then, suddenly 
and quite clearly, hke the lighted stage of a theatre, the room, with 
Miss de Vine, white as marble, on the couch and the Warden bending 
over her, and in between, on the floor, a white bowl filled with scarlet 
and the Dean kneehng beside it Then the fog-horn boomed again, 
and she heard her own voice, incredibly far-off and thin “ Tell 
Peter ” Then nothing 


Somebody had a headache — a qmte unbearably awful headache The 
white bright room in the Infirmary would have been very pleasant, if 
It hadn’t been for the oppressive neighbourhood of the person with the 
headache, who was, moreover, groamng very disagreeably It was an 
effort to pull one’s self together and find out what the tiresome pemon 
wanted With an effort like that of a hippopotamus climbing out of a 
swamp, Harriet pulled herself together and discovered that the headache 
and the groans were her own, and that the Infirmanan had realised 
what she was about and was coming to lend a hand 

** What m the world ^ ” said Harnet 

818 



“ Ah,’* said the Infirmarian, ** that’s better Xo — don’t try to sit up 
You’ve had a nasty knock on the head, and the quieter you keep the 
better ” 

** Oh, I see,” «’aid Harriet “ I’ve got a beast of a headache ” A little 
thought located the worst part of the headache somewhere behind the 
right ear She put up an exploratory liana and encountered a bandage 
“ What happened ^ ” 

That’s what we’d all like to know,” saia the Infirmanan 

** Weil, I can’t remember a thing,” said Haniet 

** It doesn’t matter Drink this ” 

Like a book, thought Harriet They always said, ** Drink this ” The 
room wasn’t really so bnght after all , the Venetian shutters were 
closed It was her own eyes that were extraordinarily sensitive to light 
Better shut them 

“ Dnnk this ” must have had something helpfully potent about it, 
because when she woke up again, the headache was better and she 
felt ravenously hungiy Also, she was bcginmng to lemember things — 
the dog-collar and the lights that wouldn’t go on — and the hands that 
had come clutching out of tlie darkness There, memory obstinately 
stopped short How the headache had come into existence she had no 
idea Then she saw again the picture of Miss de Vme stretched on the 
couch She asked after her 

“ She’s in the next room,” said the Iiifirmanan She’s had rather 
a nasty heart-attack, but she’s better now She would try to do too 
much, and, of course, finding you like that was a shock to her ” 

It was not till the evemng, when the Dean came m and found the 
patient fretting herself into a fever of cunosity, that Harriet got a 
complete story of the mght’s adventures 

“ Now, if you’ll keep quiet,” said the Dean, “ I’ll tell y^ou If not, 
not And your beautiful young man has sent you a young gardenful of 
flowers and will call again m the mommg Well, now * Poor Miss de 
Vine got here about lo o’clock — ^her tram was a bit late — and Mulhns 
met her with a message to go and see the Warden <it once However, 
she thought she’d better take her hat off first, so she went along to her 
rooiDS — all m a hurry, so as not to keep Dr Baring waiting Well, of 
course, the first thin g was that the lights wouldn’t go on , and then to 
her horror she heard you^ my dear, snorting on the floor in the dark 
So then she tried the table-lamp and that worked—and there you were, 
a nasty bluggy sight for a respectable female don to find m her sittings 
room You’ve got two beautiful stitches m you, by the way , it was the 
comer of the bookcase did that . So Miss de Vme rushed out calling 

for help, but there wasn’t a soul in the building, and then, my dear, 
she ran bke fiiry over to Burleigh and some students tore out to see 



what was happening and then somebody fetched the Warden and some- 
body else fetched the Infirmanan and somebody else fetched Miss 
Stevens and Miss Hillyard and me who were having a quiet cup of tea 
in my room, and we rang up the doctor, and Miss de Vine’s groggy 
heart went back on her, what with shock and running about, and she 
went all blue on us — we had a lovely time ” 

“ You must have One other gaudy mght * I suppose you haven’t 
found who did it ^ ” 

“ For quite a long time we hadn’t a moment to think about that part 
of It And then, lust as we were settling down, all the fuss started again 
about Anme ” 

Annie ^ What’s happened to her ^ ” 

“ Oh, didn’t you know ^ We found her in the coal-hole, my dear, m 
such a state, what with coal-dust and hammenng her fists on the door , 
and I wonder she wasn’t clean off her head, poor thing, locked up there 
ail that time And if it hadn’t been for Lord Peter we mightn’t even have 
begun to look for her till next mormng, what with everything being m 
such an uproar ” 

“ Yes — he warned her she might be attacked How did he — — ? 
Did you get him on the ’phone, or what ^ ” 

** Oh, yes Well, after we’d got you and Miss de Vine to bed and had 
made up our nunds you wouldn’t cither of you peg out yet awhile, 
somebody brightly remembered that the first thing you said when we 
picked you up was ‘ Tell Peter ’ So we rang up the Mitre and he wasn’t 
tlicre , and then Miss Hillyard said she knew where he was and ’phoned 
through That was after nudmght Fortunately, he hadn’t gone to bed 
He said he’d come over at once, and then he asked what had happened 
to Anme Wilson Miss Hillyard thought the shock had affected his wits, 
I think However, he insisted that she ought to be kept an eye on, so we 
all started to look for her Well, you know what a job it is tracking any- 
body down in this place, and we hunted and hunted and nobody had 
seen anything of her And then, just before two. Lord Peter arrived, 
looking like death, and said we were to turn the place upside-down if we 
didn’t want a corpse on our hands Nice and reassuring that was > ” 

” I wish I hadn’t missed it all,” said Harriet “ He must have thought 
I was an awfiil ass to let myself be knocked out like that ” 

He didn’t say so,” said the Dean, dnly “ He came m to see you, but 
of course you were well under the weather And of course he explained 
about the dog-collar, which had puzzled us all dreadfully ” 

** Yes She went for my throat I do remember that I suppose she 
really meant to get Miss de Vme ” 

Obviously And with her weak heart — and no dog-collar — ^she 
wouldn’t have had much chance, or so the doctor said It was very lucky 
for her you happened to go m there Or did you know ^ ” 

** I think,” said Harriet, her memory still rather confused, ** I went 
320 



to teii her about Peter’s warning and — oh, yes ’ there was something 
funnv about the window-cui tains And the lights were all olF ’’ 

“ The bulbs had been taken out Well, anyway, somewhere about four 
o’clock, Padgett found Annie She was locked up m the coal-ceilar under 
the Hail Building, at the far end of the boiler-house The icey’d been 
taken awav and Padgett had to break in the door She was poundii^g and 
shouting — but of course, if we haan’t been searcning for ner she might 
have yelled till Doomsday, especially as the radiators are off, and we’re 
not using the furnace She was m what tney call a state of collapse and 
couldn’t give us a coherent story for ever so long But there’s nothing 
really the matter v\ath her except shock and bruises where she was Bung 
down on the coal-heap And of course her hands and arms w ere prettv 
well skinned wnth battenng on the door and trying to climb out of the 
ventilator ” 

“ What did she say happened ^ ” 

“ Why, she was putting away the deck-chairs in the loggia about half- 
past nine, when somebody seized her round the neck from behind and 
frog’s-marched her off to the cellar She said it was a woman, and very 
strong ” 

** She was,” said Harnet “ I can bear witness to that Grip like steel 
And a most unfemimne vocabulary ” 

“ Anme says she never saw who it was, but she thought that the arm 
that was round her face had a dark sleeve on Anme’s own impression 
was that it was Miss Hillyard , but she was with the Bursar and me But 
a good many of our strongest specimens haven t got alibis — particularly 
Miss Pvke, who says she was in her room, and Miss Barton, who claims 
to have been in the Fiction Library, looking for a ‘ mce book to read ’ 
And Mrs Goodwin, and Miss Burrows aren’t \ery well accoimted for, 
either According to their own story, they were each seized at the same 
moment with an unaccountable desire to wander ?vLss Burrows went to 
commune with Nature m the Fellows’ Garden and Mrs Goodwm to 
commune with a higher Authority in the Chapel We are all looking 
rather askance at one another to-day ” 

“ I wish to goodness,” said Harnet, “ I’d been a tnfie more efficient ” 
She pondered a moment “ I wonder why she didr’t stay to finish me 
off” 

“ Lord Peter wondered that, too He said he thought she must either 
have thought you were dead, or been alarmed bv the blood and finding 
she’d got the wrong person When you went limp she’d probably feel 
about and she’d know you weie not Miss de Vine — short hair and no 
spectacles, you see — and she’d hurry off to get nd of any blood-stains 
before somebody came along At least, that wais his theory He looked 
pretty queer about it ” 

“ Is he here now ? ” 

“ No , he had to go back , Something about getting an early 
ON— II 



"plane from Croydon He rang up and made a great to-do, but apparent- 
ly It was all settled and he had to go If any of his prayers are heard, I 
shouldn’t think anybodv in the Government would have a whole place 
in his body this morning So I comforted him with hot coffee and he 
went off, leaving orders that neitiier you nor Miss de Vine nor Annie 
was to be left alone for a single moment And he’s rung up once from 
London and three times from Paris ” 

Poor old Peter * ” said Hariiet “ He never seems to get a night’s 
rest ” 

“ Meanwhile, the Waiden vahantly issuing an unconvincing state- 
ment to the effect that somebody played a foolish practical joke on 
Annie, that you accidentally slipped and cut your head and that Miss 
de Vine was upset by the sight of blood And the College gates are shut 
to ail comers, for fear they should be reporters in disguise But you can’t 
keep the scouts quiet — ^goodness knows what reports are going out by the 
tradesmen’s entrance However, the great thing is that nobody’s killed 
And now I must be off, or the Infirmarian will have my blood and there 
really will be an inquest ” 

The next day brought Lord Saint-George “ My turn to visit the sick,” 
he said “ You’re a luce, restful aunt for a fellow to adopt, I don’t think 
Do you realise that you’ve done me out of a dinner ^ ” 

“ Yes,” said Hamet ‘ It’s a pity — Perhaps I’d better tell the Dean 

You might be able to identify ” 

Now don’t you start laying plots,” said he, ‘‘or your temperature will 
go up You leave it to Uncle He says he’ll be back to-morrow, by the 
way, and the evidence is rolling in mcely and you’re to keep quiet and 
not worry. Honour bnght Had him on the ’phone this moimng He’s 
all of a doodah Says anybody could have done his business m Pans, only 
they’ve got it into their heads he’s the only person who can get on the 
right side of some tedious old mule or other who has to be placated or 
concihated or something As far as I can make out, some obscure 
lournalist has been assassinated and somebody’s trying to make an inter- 
national mcident of it Hence the pyramids I told you Uncle Peter had 
a strong sense of public duty , now you see it in acaon ” 

“ Well, he’s quite nght ” 

“ What an unnatural woman you are ! He ought to be here, weeping 
into the sheets and lettmg the international situation blow itself to 
blazes ” Lord Samt-George chuckled “ I wish I’d been on the road with 
him on Monday morning He collected five summonses in the round tnp 
between Warwickshire and Oxford and London My mother will be 
delighted How’s your head ^ ” 

” Doing fine It was more the cut than the bump, I think ” 

“ Scalp-wounds do bleed, don’t they ^ Completely pig-hkc Still, it’s 
as well you’re not a ‘ corpse in the case with a sad, swelled face ’ You’ll 



be all light wlien they get the stitches out Only a b*t con\'ic£-h ’ t that 
Side of the head \ oa II have to be cropped all round to evei‘ matters up 
and Uncle Peter can wear your discarded tresses next his heart 

Come^ come>’* said Harriet “ He doesn’t date back to the seventies ” 
** He’s ageing rapidly I shoula tiunk he"d nearly go^ to the sixties by 
now With beautiful, golden side-wtiiskers i really think you ought to 
rescue him before his bones starr creak and the spideis spin webs over 
his eyes ” 

"'You and your uncle,” said Harriet, ‘‘ should be set to turn phrases 
for a living ” 


CHAPTER XXII 

O no, there is no end the end is death and madness * As I am 
never better than when I am mad then methinks I am a brave 
fellow , then I do wonders but reason abuseth me, and there’s

the murderers were he as strong as Hector, thus would I tear 
and drag him up and down 

BEN JONSON 

Thursday A heavy, gloomy and depressing Thursday, pouring down 
umntercsting ram from a sky like a grey box-lid The Warden had called 
a meeting of the Semor Common Room for half-past two — an unconsol- 
mg hour. All three invalids were up and about again Harnet had 
exchanged her bandages for some very unbecoming and unromantic 
strappmgs, and had not exactly a headache, but the sensation that a 
headache might begm at any moment Miss de Vine looked like a ghost 
Annie, though she had suffered less than the others physically, seemed 
to be still haimted by nervous terrors, and crept unhappily about her 
duties with the other Common-Room maid always closely m attendance 
It was imdentood that Lord Peter Wimsey would attend the SCR 
meeting m order to lay certain information before the staff Harriet had 
received from him a bnef and characteristic note, which said 
“ Congratulations on not being dead yet I have taken your collar 
away to have my name put on ” 

She had already missed the collar And she had had, from Miss Hill- 
yard, a strangely vivid little picture of Peter, standing at her bedside 
between mght and dawn, qmte silent, and twisting the thick strap over 
and over m his hands 

All morning she had expected to see him , but he arrived only at the 
last moment, so that their meeting took place in the Common-Room, 

323 



undes the es ot all the dons He had driven straight from lown without 
changing hissi>it, and above the dark cloth his Head had the bleached 
look of a faint water-colour He paid his respects poLtely to the Warden 
and the Senior dons before coming o\ er and taking her hand 
“ Weil, and how are \ou ^ ” 

Not too bad, considermg 
“ That’s good 

He smiled, and went to sit by the Warden Harnet, at the opposite 
side of the table, slipped into a place beside the Dean Everything that 
was alive in him lay in the palm of her hand, like a npe apple Dr, 
Baring was asking him to begin, and he v\ as doing so, in the flat voice of 
a secretary reading the nunutes of a company meeting He had a sheaf 
of papers before him, including (Harriet noticed) her dossier, which he 
must have taken awav on the Monday mormng But he w^ent on without 
referring to so much as a note, addressing himself to a bov/1 filled v^ith 
mangolds that stood on the table before him 
“ I need not take up youi time by going over ail the details of this 
rather coafusmg case I will first set out the salient points as they pre- 
sented themselves to me when I came to Oxford last Sunday week, so as 
to show you the basis upon which I founded my working theory I wi)! 
then formulate that theory, and adduce the supporting evidence which I 
hope and think you will consider conclusive I may say that practically 
all the data necessary to the formation of the theory are contained m the 
very valuable digest of the events prepared for me by Miss Vane and 
handed to me on my arrival The rest of the proof was merely what the 
police call routine work ” 

(This, thought Harnet, is suiting your style to your company with a 
vengeance She looked round The Common-Room had the hushed air 
of a congregation settling dowm to a sermon, but she could feel the 
nervous tension everywhere They did not know w^hat they might be 
going to hear ) 

“ The first point to strike an outsider,” went on Peter, ** is the fact that 
these demonstrations began at the Gaudy I may say that that was the 
first bad mistake the perpetrator made By the wav, it will save time and 
trouble if I refer to the perpetrator in the time-honoured way as X If X 
had waited till term began, we should have had a much wider field for 
suspicion I therefore asked myself what it was that so greatly excited X 
at the Gaudy that she could not wait for a more suitable time to begin 
“ It seemed unlikely that any of the Old Students present could have 
roused X’s animosity, because the demonstrations continued in the 
followmg term But they did not continue during the Long Vacation 
So my attention was immediately directed to any person who entered 
the College for the first time at Gaudy and was in residence the followang 
term Only one person answered these requirements, and that was Miss 
de Vine ” 

3^4 



The hrst stir went round the table, like the wind running over a 
cornfield 

** The first two commiimcations came mio tne bands of !MifSS Vane 
One of tnem, which amounted to an accusation of murdci was slipped 
into the sleeve of her gown and might, bv a xnisitadmg coincidence, 
have been held to apply to her But Miss Martin may remember that she 
placed Mi&s Vane’s gown in the Senior Common Room '^ide by side with 
that of Miss d.e Vine I beheve that X, mis-readuing D Vane’ ais 
* H de Vine ’ put the note m the wrong gown This belief is, of course, 
not susceptible of proof , but the possibility is suggestive The error, if it 
was one, disti acted attention at the start from the ceuuai object of the 
campaign ” 

Nothing alterea m the level voice as he liftca tne old xnfamy into view 
only to cast it in the next breath into oblivion, but the hand that had held 
hers tightened foi a moment and relaxed She found herseli %vatchung the 
hand as it moved now among the sheaf of papers, 

**' The second commumcation, picked up accidentally by ^iiss V’^ane 
in the quad, was destroyed like the other , but frem the description I 
gather that it was a drawing similar to this ” Re slipped out a paper from 
under the chp and passed it to the Warden ‘‘ It rep esents a punishment 
inflicted by a naked, female figure upon another which x<? clothed in 
academical dress and epicene This appear to oe the symibohcat key to 
the situation In the Michaelmas Term, other drawings of a similar tod 
appear, togethei with the motif of tJie hanging of iome academical 
character — a motif which is repeated m the incident of the dummy 
found later on suspended in the Chapel There weie also commumcjptions 
of a vaguely obscene and threatemng sort which need not oc particularly 
considered The most intcrestmg and important one, perhaps, is the 
message addressed to (I think) Miss Hiilvard * No man is safe from 
women like you ' , and the other, sent to Miss Fiaxman, demanding that 
she should leave another student’s fianc«^c alone These suggested that 
the basis of X’s gnevance was sexual jealousy of <he ordinary’ kird — a 
suggestion whicli, again, I beheve to be entirely erroneous and to have 
obscured the issue in a qmte fantastic manner 

“ We next come (passing over the episode of tue bonfire of gowns in 
the quad) to the more serious matter of Miss Lydgate’s manuscript I do 
not think it is a comcidence that the porhoiis most neavuv oisfigured and 
obliterated were those in which Miss Lydgate attached the conclusions 
of other scholars, and those scholars, men If I am nght we see that X is 
a person capable of reading and to some extent understanding, a work 
of scholarship Together with this outrage we may take the mutilation 
of the novel called The Search at the exact point w^hert the author upholds, 
or appears for the moment to uphold, the doctnne that loyalty to the 
abstract truth must overnde all personal considerations , and also the 
burmng of Miss Barton’s book in which she attacks the Nazi doctnne 



that woman’s place in the Slate should be confined to the ^womanly’ 
occupations of Kinder^ KirctWs Kuch 

“In addition to these personal attacks upon individuals, we get the 
affair of the bonfire and the sporadic outbursts of obscenity upon the 
wails When we come to the disfiguiement of the Library, we get the 
generalised attack ^n a moie soectacular form The object of the cam- 
paign begins to show itself clearly The grievance felt by X, siartmg 
from a single person, has extended itself to the entire College, and the 
intention is to provoke a scandal, which may bring the whole body 
into disrepute ” 

Here foi the first time the speaker Lfted his gaze from the bowl of 
marigolds, let it travel slowly round the table, and brought it to rest upon 
the Warden’s intent face * 

“ Will you let me say, here and now, that the one thing which frus- 
trated the whole attack from fiist to last was the remarkable solidarity 
and public spirit displayed by your college as a body I think that was the 
last obstacle that X expected lo encounter in a community of women. 
Nothing but the very great loyaltv of the Senior Common Room to the 
College and the respect of the students for the Senior Common Room 
stood between you and a most unpleasant publicity It is the merest 
presumption in me to tell you what you already know far better than I 
do , but I say it, not only for my own satisfaction, but because this 
particular kind of loyaltv forms at once the psychological excuse for the 
attack and the only possible defence against it ” 

“ Thank you,” said the Warden I feel sure that everybody here will 
know how to appreciate that ” 

** We come next,” resumed Wimsey, his eyes once more on the man- 
golds, “ to the incident of the dummy m the Chapel This merely repeats 
the theme of the earl> drawmgs, but with a greater eye to dramatic 
effect Its evidential importance lies in the * Harpy ’ quotation pinned to 
the dummy , the mysterious appearance of a black figured frock which 
nobody could identify , the subsequent conviction of the ex-porter Jukes 
for theft , and the finding of the mutilated newspaper in Miss de Vine’s 
room, which closed that sequence of events I will take up those points 
later 

“ It was about this tune that Miss Vane made the acquaintance of 
my nephew Saint-George, and he mentioned to her that, under cir- 
cumstances mto which we need not, perhaps, mquire, he had met a 
mysterious women one mght in your Fellows’ Garden, and that she had 
told him two things One that Shrewsbury College was a place where 
they murdered beautiful boys like him and ate their hearts out , seconly 
that * the other had fair hair, too ’ ” 

This piece of information was new to most of the Senior Common 
Room, and caused a mild sensation 

“ Here we have the ‘ murder-motif’ emphasised, with a little detail 
326 



abotit the victim He is a man, fair, handsome and comparaiivti) voung. 
My nephew then said he would not undertake to recogn*st ihe woman 
again , but on a subsequent occasion he saw and did recognise her 
Once again the tremor passed round the table 
“ The next important di&turbant e was the affaii of the missing fuses 
Here the Dean could contam herself no longei and burst out 
“ What a lovely title for a thriller * 

The veiled eves lifted instantly and the laughter-lmes gathered at the 
corners 

* Perfect And that was all it was X rehred, having accomplished 
nothing but a thriller with good publicity value ” 

And it was after i/iat,” said Miss de Vine, ‘‘ that tne newspaper was 
found m rny room 

“ Yes/* said Wimsey , “ mine was a rahonal, not a chronological 
grouping That brings us to the end of the Hilary Term The 

Vacation passed without incident In the Summer Term, we are faced 
with the cumulative effect of long and insidious persecution upon a scholar 
of sensiti\e temperament That w^as the most dangeious phase of X*s 
activities We know that other students besides Miss Newland had 
received letters wishing them bad luck in their Schools , happily, Miss 
Layton and the rest were of tougher fibre But I should like particu- 
larly to draw your attention to the fact that, with a few unimportant 
exceptions, the ammus was all directed against dons and scholars ** 

Here the Bursar, who had been manifesting irritation for some time, 
broke in 

I cannot imagine why they are making ail that noise underneath 
this building Do you mind, Warden, if I send out and stop it ^ 

“ I sorry,** said Wimsey “ I am afraid I am responsible for that 
I suggested to Padgett that a search m the coal -cellar might be 
profitable ’* 

“ Then,*’ pronounced the Warden, “ I fear we must put up with it, 
Bursar ” She mclmed her head towards Wimsey, who went on 

‘‘ This IS a brief summary of the events as presented to me by Miss 
Vane, when, with your consent, Warden, she laid the case before me I 
rather gathered **— here the right hand became restless and began to 
beat out a silent tattoo upon the table-top — “ that she and some others 
among you were inclined to look upon the outrages as the outcome 
repressions sometimes accompanying the celibate life and issuing in an 
obscene and unreasoning mahce directed partly against the conditions 
of that life and partly against persons who enjoyed or had enjoyed or 
imght be supposed to enjoy a wider expeiience There is no doubt that 
mahce of that kind exists But the histor>^ of the case seemed to me to 
offer a psychological picture of an entirely different kind One member 
of this Common-Room has been mamed, and another is engaged to be 
marned , and neither of these, \vho ouebt to have been the hrst victiirs, 



were (so far as I know) persecuted at all The dominance oi the naked 
female hgure m the eaiiy drawing is also highly significant So is the 
destruction of I\iiss Barton’s book Also, the bias displayed by X seemed 
to be strongly anti-scholastic, and to have a more or less rational motive, 
based on some injury amounting in X’s imnd to murder, inflicted upon a 
male person by a female scholar The grievance seemed, to my mind, to 
be felt pnncipail) against Miss de Vine, and to be extended, from her, to 
the whole College and possibly to educated v^omen in general I therefore 
felt we should look for a woman either married oi with sexual expenence, 
of limited education but some acquaintance with scholars and scholar- 
ship, whose past was in some way linked with that of Miss de Vine, and 
(though this was an assumption) who had probably come into residence 
later than last December ’ 

Harriet twisted her glance away from Peter’s hand, which had ceased 
Its soft drumming and now lay flat on the table, to estimate the effect of 
this on his hearers Miss de Vine was frowning as though her mind, 
runmng back over the years, were dispassionately considering her claim 
to have done murder , Miss Ginlpenc’s face wore a troubled blush, and 
Mrs Goodwin’s an air of protest , in Miss Hillyard’s eyes was an extra- 
ordinary mixture of triumph and embarrassment , Miss Barton was 
nodding quiet assent, Miss Allison smiling, Miss Shaw faintly affronted , 
Miss Edwards was looking at Peter wnth eyes that said frankly, “ You 
are the sort of person I can deal with ” The Warden’s grave countenance 
was expressionless The Dean’s profile gave no due to her feelings, but 
she uttered a little, quick sigh that sounded like relief 

** X will now come,” said Peter, “ to the material clues First, the 
printed messages It seemed to me extremely unlikely that these could 
have been produced, in such quantity, within the College walls, without 
leaving some trace of their ongin I was inclined to look for an outside 
source Similarly with the figured dress found on the dummy , it seemed 
very strange that nobody should ever Uave set eyes on it before though it 
was several seasons old Thirdly, there was the odd circumstance that 
the letters which came by post were always received either on a Monday 
or a Thu^^day, as though Sunday and Wednesday were the only days on 
which letters could conveniently be posted from a distant post-office or 
box These three consideiations rmght have suggested someone hving at 
a distance, who visited Oxford only twice a week But the mghtly dis- 
turbances made it plain that the person actually lived within the walls, 
with fixed days for going outside them and a place somewhere outside, 
where clothes could be kept and letters prepared The person who would 
fulfil these conditions best would be one of the scouts ” 

Miss Stevens and Miss Barton both stirred, 

** The majority of the scouts, however, seemed to be ruled out Those 
who were not confined withm the Scouts’ Wing at mght were trusted 
women of long service here — most unlikely to fulfil any of the other con- 



ditioob Most oJ tlioire an me Scouts'* Wiag slept two m a room, aad 
therefore (unless two ot them were in collusion) could not possibly escape 
into the College night after rnghi without being suspected This left only 
those who had separ^-te bedrooms Game, the head scout , Anme, the 
scout attached fiist to hh.ss Lvdgate’s staircase and subsequently to the 
Senioi Common Room and a thud scout Ethel an e*deri> and highly 
reputable woman Of these tlirce, i\iinie cot responded most closely to 
the psychological pictoie of X , for she had been ma iied and had the 
afternoon of Sunday and the aiternoon and evemi^g of Wednesday free , 
she also had hei children donuciled in the town and therefoie a place 
where she could keep clothes and prepare letters ’ 

«« But began the Bursar, indignantly 

This iS onlv the case as I saw it last Sunday weel,’ said Wimsey 
* Certain poweiful objections at once presented themsei\es The Scouts’ 
Wing was shut off by iorked doois and gates But it was made clear at the 
Cfme of the Libraiy episode that the buttery hatch was occasionally left 
open for the convemence of students wishing to obtain supplies late at 
night Miss Hudson had, in fact, expected to find it open that very 
night When Miss Vane tried it, it was, m fact, locked But that was 
after X had left the Library and you wuli remember that X was shown to 
have been trapped m the Hall Building by Miss Vane and Miss Hudson 
at one end and Miss Barton at the other The assumption made at the 
time was that she had been hiding in the Hall 
“ After that episode, greater care was taken to see that the buttery 
hatch was kept locked, and I learn that the key, which was previously 
left on the inner side of the hatch, was removed and placed on Carrie’s 
key-ring But a key can very readily be cut in a single day Actually, it 
was a week before the next nocturnal episode occurred, which carries us 
over the following Wednesday, when a key abstracted from Carrie’s 
bimch might readily have been copied and returned (I know for a fact 
that such a key was cut on that Wednesday by an ironmonger in the lower 
part of the town, though I have not been able to identify the purchaser 
But that is merely a routine detail ) There was one consideration which 
inclined Miss Vane to exonerate all the scouts, and that was, that no 
woman m that position would be likely to express her resentment m the 
Latin quotation from the ^netd found attached to the dummy 

“ This objection had some weight with me, but not a great deal. It 
was the only message that was not in English, and it was one to wmeh 
any school child might easily have access On tne other hand, the fact 
that it was umque among the other senpts made me sure that it had 
some particular sigmficance I mean, it wasn’t that X’s feelings 
habitually expressed themselves m LaUn hexameters There must be 
somethinff speaal aboujt that passage besides its general applicability 
to unnaturd females who snatch the meat from men’s mouths Me 
mvm ulla pfstis ”

** Wncn I fiA'at heaid ot Dsoise m vliss Hillyard, “ I felt sure 

tiaat a man was behind all tim ” 

* That was probably a sound instinct,” ajaid Wim»«*y “ I ieel sure that 
a man d>d write that Well, I need not take up time with pointing 

out how easy it was for anyboay to wander about the College at night 
and plav tncka. on people In a community of two hundred people, some 
of whom scat cely know one another by sight, it is harder to find a person 
than to lose her But the intrusion of Jukes upon the situation at that 
moment was rather awkward for X Miss Vane showed, and announced, 
a disposition to inquire rather too closely into Jukes’s home-life As a 
result somebody who knew a good deal about Jukes’s little habits laid 
an information and Jukes was lemoved to gaol Mrs Jukes took refuge 
With her rclaiions and \nnie s children were sent away to Headington, 
And ill order that we should feel quite sure that the Jukes household had 
nothing to do with the matter, a mutilated newspaper appeared shortly 
afterwards in Miss de Vine’s room ” 

Harriet looked up 

“ I did work that out — eventually But what happened last week 
seemed to make it quite impossible ” 

i don’t think,” said Peter, “ you approached the problem — ^forgive 
me for saying so — with an unprejudiced mind and undivided attention 
Something got between you and the facts ” 

** Miss Vane has been helping me so generously with my books,” 
murmured Miss Lydgate, contntely , and she has had her own work to 
do as well We really ought not to have asked her to spare any time for 
our problems ” 

” I had plenty ot time,” said Harnet “ I was only stupid ” 

At any rate,” said Wimsey, “ Miss Vane did enough to make X feel 
she was dangerous At the beginning of this term, we find X becoming 
more desperate and more deadly in mtention With the lighter evemngS;, 
It becomes more difficult to play tricks at night There is the psychological 
attempt on Miss Newland’s life and reason and, when that fails, an 
effort IS made to create a stink m the University by sending letters to the 
Vice-Chancellor However, the Umversity proved to be as sohd as the 
College , having let the women in, it was not prepared to let them down 
This was no doubt exasperating to the feelings of X Dr Threep acted 
as intermediary between the Vice-Chancellor and yourselves, and the 
matter was presumably dealt with 

I informed the Vice-Chancellor,’ said the Warden “ that steps 
were being taken ” 

“ Quite so , and you complimented me by asking me to take those 
steps I had very little doubt from the start as to the identity of X , but 
suspicion IS not proof, and I was anxious not to cast any suspicion that 
could not be justified My first task was obviously to find out whether 
Miss de Vine had actually ever murdered or injured anybody In the 

3ao 



course of a verv inteiesting aftei -dinner conversation m this room, she 
infoimed me that, six years ago, she had been instrumental in depriving 
a man of his reputation and iivehhood — ^and we decided, if you remem- 
ber, that this was an action which any manlv man or womanly woman 
might be disposed to resent “ 

Do you mean to sav,*^ cried the Dean, that all that discussion was 
intended merely to bnrig out that storv ” 

I offered an opportunity for the story^s appearance certainly , bat 
if it hadn’t come out then I should have asked foi it Incidentally, I 
established foi a certainty what I was sure of in my own mmd from the 
start, that there was not a woman in this Common Room, marrxed or 
single, who would be leady to place personal loyalties above professional 
honour That was a point which it seemed necessar)^ to make clear — ^not 
so much to me, as to yourselves ’’ 

The Warden looked from Miss Hillyard to Mrs Goodwin and back at 
Peter 

“ Yes,** she said, “ I think it was w'lse to establish that ** 

“ The next day,** said Peter, “ I asked Miss de Vine for the name of the 
man m question, whom w^e already knew to be handsome and manied 
The name was Arthur Robinson , and with this information I set out to 
find what had become of him My working theory was that X was either 
the wife or some relation of Robinson that she had come here when 
Miss de Vine’s appointment was announced, wnith the intention of 
revenging his misfortunes upon Miss de Vine, tlie College and academic 
women in general , and that in all probability X was a person who stood 
m some close relation to the Jukes family This theory was strengthened 
by the discovery that information was laid against Jukes by an 
anonymous letter similar to those arculated here 

Now, the first thing that happened after my arrival was the appear- 
ance of X in the Science-Lecture Room The idea that X was courting 
discovery by preparing letters in that pubhc and dangerous manner was 
patently absurd The whole thing was a clear fake, intended to mislead, 
and probably to establish an ahbu The commumcations had been 
prepared elsewhere and deliberately planted— m fact, there were not 
enough letters left in the box to finish the message that had been begun to 
Miss Vane* The room chosen was in full view of the Scouts* Wing, and 
the big ceiling light was conspicuously turned on, though there was a 
reading-lamp m the room, in good working order , it was Annie who 
drew Game’s attention to the light m the window , Annie was the only 
person who claimed to have actually seen X , and while the alibi was 
established for both scouts, Annie was the one who most closely 
corresponded to the conditions required for X ” 

** But Came heard X m the room,” said the Dean 
Oh, yes,” said Wirasey, smilmg “ And Came was sent to fetch you 
while ^anie removed the stnngs that had swtehed out the hght and 

331 



overturned the blackboard from the other side of the door I pointed out 
to you, you know^ that the top of the door had been thoroughly dusted 
so that the mark of tne string shouldn’t chow ” 

“ But the marks on the dark-room window-sill ” said the Dean 

“ Quite genuine Sne got out there the firet time, leaving the doors 
locked on the inside and strev>mg a few ol Miss de Vine’s hairpins about 
to produce convictior Then she let herselt into the Scouts’ Wing through 
the Buttery, called up Game and brought hei along to see the fun 
I thmk, by the wav, that someone of the scouts must have had her 
suspicions Perhaps she had found Anme’s bedroom door mysteriously 
locked on vanous occasions, or had met her m tne passage at mcon- 
vemeiit times An>how, the time had obviously arnved for establishing 
an alibi I nazarded the suggestion tnat nocturnal ramblmgs would cease 
from that time on , and so they did And I don’t suppose wc siiall ever 
find that extra 1 ey to tne Buttery ” 

Ail very ‘Veli,” sa^d Miss Edwards “ But you still have no 
proof ” 

No I went away to get it In the meantime, X— if you don’t like my 
identification— decided that Miss Vane was dangerous, and laid a trap 
to catch her This didn’t come off, because Miss Vane very sensibly 
telephoned back to College to confirm the mystenous message she had 
received at Somerville The message was sent from an outside call-box 
on the Wednesday night at lo 40 Just before eleven, Ajime came m from 
her day off and heard Padgett speak to Miss Vane on the ’phone She 
didn’t hear the conversation, but she probably heard the name 

Although the attempt had not come off, I felt sure that another 
would be made, either on Miss Vane, Miss de Vine or the suspicious 
scout— or on al! three I issued a warmng to that effect The next thing 
that happened was that Miss Vane’s chessmen were destroyed That was 
rather unexpected It looked less like alarm than personal hatred Up 
till tiiat time. Miss Vane had been treated with almost as muen tender- 
ness as though she had been a womanly woman Gan you tlunk of 
anything that can have given X that impression, Miss Vane ^ ” 

‘‘ I don’t know,” said Harriet, confused “ I asked kindly after the 
children and spoke to Beatie— good Heavens, yes, Beatie » — ^when I met 
them And I remember once agreeing pohtely with Anme that mamage 
might be a good thing if one could find the right person ” 

That was pohtic if unpnnciplcd And how about the attentive Mr 
Jones of Jesus If you will bring young men into the College at mght 

and hide them m the Chapel ” 

“ Good gracious * ” exclaimed Miss Pyke. 

— ■ you must be expected to be thought a womanly woman However , 
that IS of no great importance I fear the illusion was destroyed when you 
publicly informed me that personal attachments must come second to 
public duties ” 

S32 



** But,” said Miss Edwards, impatientiy, “ what happened to Arthur 
Robinson ^ ” 

“ He was married to a woman called Charlotte Ann Clarke, who had 
been his landlady’s daughter His first child, born eight years ago, was 
called Beatrice After the trouble at Yoik, he changed his name to 
Wilson and took a post as jumor master m a small preparatory school, 
where they didn’t mind taking a man who nad been depn\ed of his 
M A 5 so long as he was cheap His second daughter, born shortly 
afterwards, was named Carola I’m afraid the Wilsons didn’t find life too 
easy He lost his first job — drink was the reason, I’m afiaid — took 
another — got into trouble again and three years ago blew his brains out 
There were photographs in the local paper Here they are, you see A 
fair, handsome man of about thirty-eight — irresolute, attractive, some- 
thing of my nephew’s type And here is the photograph of the widow ** 

“ You arc tight, * said the Warden “ That is Annie Wilson ” 

“Yes If you read the report of the inquest, you will see that he left a 
letter, saymg that he had been hounded to death — lather a ramblmg 
letter, contaimng a Latin quotation, which the coioner obhgingly 
translated ” 

“ Good gracious ^ ” sa^d Miss Pyke Truttus hand tilts monstrum — f ” 

“ Ita A man wrote that after all, you sec , so Miss HiUyard was so far 
right Annie Wilson, being obliged to do something to support her 
children and herself, went into service ” 

“ I had very good references with her,” said the Bursar 
“ No doubt , why not ^ She must somehow have kept track of Miss dc 
Vine’s movements , and when the appointment was announced last 
Ghnstmas, she applied for a job here She probably knew that, as an 
unfortunate widow with two small children, she would receive kindly 
consideration ” 

“ What did I tell you ^ ” cned Miss Hillyard “ I always said that this 
ridiculous sentimentality about married women would be the mm of all 
discipline in this College Their minds are not, and cannot be, on their 
work ” 

“ Oh, dear » ” said Miss Lydgate “ Poor soul ’ brooding over that 
grievance m this really unbalanced w^ay * If only we had known we could 
surely have none something to make her sec the thing in a more rational 
light Did It never occui to you, Miss de Vine, to inquire what happened 
to this unhappy man Robinson ^ ” 

“ I am afraid it did not ” 

“ Why should you ^ ” demanded Miss Hillyard 
The noise in the coal-cellar had ceased within the last few minutes As 
though the silence had roused a train of association in her nund, Miss 
Ghiiperic turned to Peter and said, hesitatmgly 

“ If poor Annie really did all these dreadfiil things, how did she get 
shut up in the coal-hole ? ” 


333 



"" All ’ said Peter “ liiat coal-hole \ery nearly shook my faith in 
my theory , especially as I didn’t get the report from my re^^eaich-slaff 
till yesterday But when you come to think oi itj what else coaid she do ^ 
She laid a plot to attack Miss de Vine on her leturn from Town — tne 
scouts piobably knew wnich tram she was coming by ” 

“ Nellie kneWt” said Harriet 

“ Tnen she could have told Annie By an extraoidmarv piCce of good 
fortune, the attack was delivered— not against Miss de Vme, who would 
have been taken unawares and whose heart is not stiong, but against a 
younger and stronger woman, who was, up to a certain point, prepared 
to meet it Even so, it was serious enough, and might easily have proved 
fatal I find it difficult to forgjive myself for not having spoken earlier— 
with or without proof— and put the suspect undei observation ” 

“ Oh, nonsense ? ” said Harriet, quicJ<ly “ If you had, she might have 
chucked the whole thing for the rest of the term, and we should still not 
know anything definite I wasn’t much hurt ” 

No But it might not have been you I knew you were ready to take 
the risk , but I had no right to expose Miss de Vine.” 

It seems to me,” said Miss de Vine, “ that the risk was rightly and 
properly mine.” 

” The worst responsibility rests on me,” said the Warden. “ I should 
have telephoned the warmng to you before you left Town ” 

” Whose ever fault it was,” said Peter, ‘‘ it was Miss Vane who was 
attacked Instead of a mce, quiet throttling, there was a nasty fall and a 
lot of blood, some of which, no doubt, got on to the assailant’s hands and 
dress She was in an awkward position She had got the wrong person, 
she was bloodstained and dishevelled, and Miss de Vine or somebody 
else nught arrive at any moment Even if she ran quickly back to her own 
room, she might be seen — her uniform was stained — and when the body 
was found (alive or dead) she would be a marked woman Her only 
possible chance was to stage an attack on herself She went out through 
the back of the loggia, threw herself into the coal-cellar, locked the door 
on herself and proceeded to cover up Miss Vane’s bloodstains with her 
own By the way, Miss Vane, if you remembered anything of your 
lesson, you must have marked her wrists for her ” 

I’ll swear I did,” said Hamet 

“ But any amount of bruising may be caused by trying to scramble 
through a ventilator Well The evidence, you see, is still circumstantial — 
even though my nephew is prepared to identify the woman he saw cross- 
ing Magdalen Bndge on Wednesday with the woman he met in the 
garden One can catch a Headington bus from the other side of Magda- 
len Bndge Meanwhile, you heard this fellow m the cellarage ^ If I am 
not mistaken, somebody is arriving with something hke direct proof ” 

A heavy step in the passage was followed bv a knock on the door , and 
Padgett followed the knock almost before he was told to come in 
334 



clothes bore traces of coal-dustj though some hasty washing had 
evidently been done to his hands and face 

** Excuse me, madam Warden, miss,®’ said Padgett “ Here you arc, 
Major Right down at the bottom of the ’eap ®Ad to shift the whole lot, 

I had ” 

He laid a large key on the table 

“ Have you tried it in the cellar-door ^ 

“ Yes, sir But there wasn’t no need ’Ere’s mv label on it* ‘ Goal 
cellar ’ — see ^ ” 

** Easy to lock yourself in and hide the key Thank you, Padgett ” 

“ One moment, Padgett,” said the Warden “ I want to see Annie 
Wilbon Will you please find her and bring her here ” 

Better not,” said Wimsey, m a low tone 

** I certainly shall,” said the Warden, sharply “ You have made a 
public accusation against this unfortunate woman, and it is only right 
that she should be given an opportumty to answer it Bring her here at 
once, Padgett ’ 

Peter’s hands made a last eloquent gesture of resignation as Padgett 
went out* 

“ I think it IS very necessary,” said the Bursar, ** that this matter 
should be cleared up completely and at once ” 

Do you really think it wise, Warden '> ” asked the Dean 
Nobody shall be accused in this College,” said the Warden, without 
a hearing* Your arguments, Lord Peter, appear to be most convincing , 
but the evidence may bear some other interpretation Annie Wilson is, 
no doubt, Charlotte Ann Robinson , but it does not follow that she is 
the author of the disturbances I admit that appearances are against her, 
but there may be falsification or comcidence The key, for example, may 
have been put into the coal-cellar at any time withm the last three 
days ” 

“ I have been down to see Jukes,” began Peter , when the entrance of 
Annie interrupted him Neat and subdued as usual, she approached the 
Warden 

“ Padgett said you wished to see me. madam ” Then her eye fell on 
the newspaper spread out upon the table, and she drew in her breath 
with a long, sharp hiss, while her eyes went round the room like the eyes 
of a hunted animal 

“Mrs Robinson,” said Peter, quickly and quietly “We can quite 
understand how you came to fed a grievance— perhaps a justifiable 
gnevance — against the persons responsible for the sad death of your 
husband But how could you bnng vourself to let your children help you 
to prepare those horrible messages ^ Didn’t you reahse that if anything 
had happened they might have been called upon to bear witness in 
court ^ ” 

“ No, they wouldn’t,” she said quickly “ They knew nothing about 

SB 



It* They only helped to cut out the letters Do you think I’d let them 
suffer ^ My God * You can’t do that . • . I say you canH do it. 

. , , You beasis, I’d kill myself first ” 

Anme,” said Dr. Baring, “ are we to understand that you adroit 
being responsible for all these abominable disturbances ^ I sent for you 

m order that you might clear yourself of certain suspicions which ” 

“ Clear myself * I wouldn’t trouble to clear mvself You smug hypo 
crites — I’d like to see you bring me into court I’d laugh in your faces 
How would you look sitting there while I told the judge how that woman 
there killed my husband ^ ” 

** I am exceedingly disturbed,” said Miss de Vine, “ to hear about ail 
this I knew nothing of it till just now But indeed I had no choice in the 

matter I could not foresee the consequences — and even if I had ” 

You wouldn’t have cared You killed him and you didn’t care I say 
you murdered him What had he done to you ^ What haim had he done 
to anybody ^ He only wanted to live and be happy You took the bread 
out of his mouth and flung his children and me out to starve What did it 
matter to you ? You had no children You hadn’t a man to care about, 
I know all about >ou You had a man once and you threw him over 
because it was too much bother to look after him But couldn’t you leave 
my man alone ^ He told a he about somebody else who was dead and 
dust hundreds of years ago Nobody was the worse for that Was a dirty 
bit of paper more important than all our lives and happiness? You 
broke him and killed him — all for nothing Do you think that’s a woman’s 

“ Most unhappily,” said Miss de Vine, “ it was my job ” 

“ What business had you with a job like that ^ A woman’s job is to 
look after a husband and children I wish I had killed you I wish I 
could kill you all I wish I could bum down this place and all the places 
like it — where you teach women to take men’s jobs and rob them first 
and kill them afterwards ” 

She turned to the Warden ' 

” Don’t you know what you’re doing ^ I’ve heard you sit round 
smvellmg about unemployment — ^but it’s you, it’s women like you who 
take the work away from the men and break their hearts and li\es No 
wonder you can’t get men for yourselves and hate the women who can. 
God keep the men out of your hands, that’s what I say You’d destroy 
your own husbands, if you had any, for an old book or bit of wntmg 
, . I loved my husband and you broke his heart If he’d been a thief or 
a murderer, I’d have loved him and stuck to him He didn’t mean to 
steal that old bit of paper — he only put it away It made no diflfercncc to 
anybody It wouldn’t have helped a single man or woman or child in 
the world — it wouldn’t have kept a cat alive , but you killed him 
for it ” 

Peter had got up and stood behind Miss de Vine, with his hand over 
836 



her wnst She shook her head Immovabie, implacablcj thought Hamet ^ 
this won’t make her pulse miss a single beat The rest of the Cbmmon- 
Room looked merely stunned 

** Ohj no * said Anme, echomg Hamet s thoughts Sh feels 
nothing None of them feel anything You brazen deviis — you all stand 
together You’re only frightened for your skms and your miserable 
reputations I scared you all, didn’t I ^ God ^ how I laughed to see you 
ail look at one another * You didn’t even trust each other You can’t 
agree about anythmg except hating decent women and tiieir men I 
wish I’d tom the throats out of the lot of you It would have been too 
good for you, though I wanted to see you thrown out to starve, hke us 
I wanted to see you all dragged into the gutter I wanted to see you — 
you — sneered at and trampled on and degraded and despised as we were. 
It would do you good to learn to scrub floors for a living as I’ve done, 
and use your hands lor something, and say ‘ madam ’ to a lot of scum 
But I made you shake in your sho^, anyhow You couldn’t even 
find out who was doing it — that’s all your wonderful brains come to. 
There’s nothing in your books about life and marriage and children, is 
there ^ Nothing about desperate people — or love — or hate or anything 
human You’re ignorant and stupid and helpless You’re a lot of fools 
You can’t do anything for yourselves Even you, you silly old hags — ^you 
had to get a man to do your work for you 

“ Tou brought him here ” She leaned over Hamet with her fierce eyes, 
as though she would have fallen on her and tom her to pieces “ And 
you’re the dirtiest hypocrite of the lot I know who you are You had a 
lover once, and he died You chucked him out because you were too 
proud to marry him You were his mistress and you sucked him dry, and 
you didn’t value him enough to let him make an honest woman of you 
He died because you weren’t there to look after him I suppose you’d say 
you loved him You don’t know what love means It means stickmg to 
your man through thick and thin and putting up with everything But 
you take men and use them and throw them away when you’ve finished 
with them They come after you like wasps round a jam-jar, and then 
they fail *n and ic What are you gomg to do with that one there ^ You 
send for when you need him to do your dirty work, and when you’ve 
finished with hm you’ll get nd of him You don’t want to cook his meals 
and mend his clothes and bear his children like a decent woman You’ll 
use him, like any other tool, to break me You’d like to sec me m prison 
and my children in a home, because you haven’t the guts to do your 
proper job m the world The whole bunch of you together haven’t flesh 
and blood enough to make you fit for a man As foTjyou ” 

Peter had come back to his place and was sitting with his head in his 
hands She went over and shook him furiously by the shoulder, and as he 
looked up, spat m his face “ You I you dirty traitor ’ You rotten little 
white-faced mt * It’s men like you that make women like this You don’t 

337 



know how to do anything but talk What ao you know about Me, with 
your title and your money and your clothes and motor-cars ^ You’ve 
never done a hand’s turn of honest work You can buy all the women you 
want Wives and mothers may rot and die for all you care, while you 
chatter about duty and honour Nobody would sacrifice anything for 
you — whv should they ^ That woman’s making a fool of you and you 
can’t see it If she marries you for your money she’ll make a worse fool of 
you, and you’ll deserve it You’re fit for nothing but to keep your hands 
white and father other men’s children What are you going to do 
now, all of you ^ Run away and squeal to the magistrate because I made 
fools of you all ^ You daren’t You’re afraid to come out into the light 
You’re afraid for your precious college and your precious selves Pm not 
afraid I did nothing but stand up for my own flesh and blood Damn 
you * I can laugh at you all ^ You daren’t touch me You’re afraid of me 
I had a husband and I loved him — ^and you were jealous of me and you 
blled him Oh, God ’ You killed him among you, and we never had a 
happy moment again ” 

She suddenly burst out crying — ^half dreadful and half grotesque, 
with her cap crooked and her hands twisting her apron into a knot 

“ For Heaven’s sake,” muttered the Dean, desperately, “ can’t this 
be stopped ? ” 

Here Miss Barton got up 

” Come, Anme,” she said, briskly. ” We are all very sorry for you, but 
you mustn’t behave in this foolish and hystencal way What would the 
children think if they saw you now ^ You had better come and lie down 
quietly and take some aspinn Rursar I will you please help me out with 
her ^ ” 

Miss Stevens, galvanized, got up and took Anme’s other arm, and all 
three went out together The Warden turned to Peter, who stood 
mechamcally wiping his face with his handkerchief and looking at 
nobody 

” I apologise for allowing this scene to take place. I ought to have 
known better You were perfectly nght ” 

” Of course he was nght * ” cned Hamet Her head was throbbing 
like an engme. “ He’s always nght He said it was dangerous to care for 
anybody. He said love was a brute and a devil You’re honest, Peter, 

aren’t you ? Damned honest Oh, God * let me get out of here I’m 

going to be sick ” 

She stumbled blindly against him as he held the door open for her, 
and he had to steer her with a firm hand to the cloak-room door When 
he came back, the Warden had risen, and the dons with her They looked 
stupefied with the shock of seeing so amany feelings stopped naked m 
pubhc 

” Of course, Miss de Vine,” the Warden was saying, ” no sane person 
could possibly think of blaming you ” 

33B 



“ I’haak yon^ Warden * s^L^d Mjss de Vine ** Nobody, perhaps, but 
myself 

“ Lord Fe^cr/^ sa d the Waraen, a little later on, when we are all 

feeling more ourselv^es, I think we shoiud ail like to say ” 

Please don’t,’® said ne ‘‘ It doesn’t matter at all ” 

The Warden went out, and the rest followed her like mutes at a 
funeral, leaving only Miss de Vine, sittmg solitary beneath the window. 
Peter shut the door after them and came up to her He was still passing 
his handkerchief acioss his mouth Becoming aware of this, he tossed the 
linen into the waste-paper basket 

* I do blame myiself,” said Miss de Vine less to Inm than to herself. 
** Most bitterly Not for my original action, which was unavoidable, but 
for the sequel Nothing you can say to me could make me feel more 
responsible than I do already 

“ I can have nothing to say,” said he “ Like you and every member 
of this Common-Room, I admit the prmciple and the consequences must 
follow ” 

“ That won’t do,” said the Fellow, blundy “ One ought to take some 
thought for other people Miss Lydgate would have done what I did m 
the first place , but she would have made it her business to see what 
became of that unhappy man and his wife ” 

“ Miss Lydgate is a very great and a very rare person But she could 
not prevent other people from sufFenng for her pnnciples That seems to 
be what principles are for, somehow I don’t claim, you know,” 
he added, with something of his famihar diffidence, ** to be a Christian 
or anythmg of that kind But there’s one thing m the Bible that seems to 
me to be a mere statement of brutal fact— -I mean, about brmging not 
peace but a sword ” 

Miss de Vine looked up at him cunously 
“ How much Q.Teyou going to suffer for this ^ ” 

“ God knows,” he said “ That’s my look out Perhaps not at all In 
any case, you know, I’m with you— every time ” 

When Harriet emerged from the cloak-room, she found Miss de Vme 
alone 

“ Thank Heaven, they’ve gone,” said Harnet “ I’m afraid I made 
an exhibition of myself It was rather— shattermg, wasn’t it ^ What’s 
happened to Peter ^ ” 

“ He’s gone,” said Miss de Vme 
She hesitated, and then said 

Miss Vane — ^I’ve no wish to pry impertinently into your affairs Stop 
me if I saying too much But we have talked a good deal about 
facing the facts Isn’t it time you faced the facts about that man ? ” 

** I have been facing one fact for some time,” said Hamet, stanng out 
with unseemg eyes into the quad, “ and that is, that if I once gave way to 
Peter, I should go up like straw ” 



That/® said Miss de Vme, dniy, “ is moderately obvioiis How often 
has he used that weapon against vou ^ 

Never/® said Harriet, remembenng the moments when he might 
have used it ‘‘ Never *® 

“ Then what are you afraid of? Yourself^ 

** Isn’t this afternoon warmng enough ^ ” 

Perhaps You have had the luck to come up against a very unselfish 
and a \ery honest man He has done what you asked him without caring 
what It cost him and without shirking the issue He hasn’t tried to dis- 
guise the facts or bias your judgment You admit that, at any rate ’ 

“ I suppose he realised how I should feel about it ^ ” 

“ Realised it ? ” said Miss de Vine, with a touch of irritation “ My 
dear girl, give bun the credit for the brains he’s got They are very good 
ones He is painfully sensitive and far more intelligent than is good for 
him But I really don’t think you can go on like this You won’t break 
his patience or his control or his spirit , but you may break his health 
He looks like a person pushed to the last verge of endurance ” 

** He’s been rushing about and working very hard,” said Harriet, 
defensively “ I shouldn’t be at all a comfortable person for him to live 
with I’ve got a devilish temper ” 

** Well, that’s his nsk, if he likes to take it. He doesn’t seem to lack 
courage ” 

I should only make his life a misery ” 

“ Very well If you are determined that you’re not fit to black his 
boots, tell him so and send him away ” 

“ I’ve been trying to send Peter away for five years It doesn’t have 
that effect on him ” 

“ If you had really tned, you could have sent him away in five minutes 
, Forgive me I don’t suppose you’ve had a very easy time with 
yourself But it can’t have been easy for him, either — ^looking on at it, 
and quite powerless to interfere ” 

“ Yes I almost wish he had interfered, instead of being so horribly 
intelligent. It would be quite a rehef to be ridden over rough-shod for a 
change ” 

** He will never do that That’s hu weakness He’ll never make up 
your mind for you You’ll have to make your own decisions You needn’t 
be afraid of losmg your independence , he will always foice it back on 
you If you ever find any kind of repose with him, it can only be the 
repose of very delicate balance ” 

“ That’s what he says himself If you were me, should you like to maiT> 
a man like that ^ ” 

“ Frankly,” said Miss de Vme, I should not I would not do it for 
any consideration A marriage of two independent and equally irritable 
mtelligences seems to me reckless to the point of insamty You can hurt 
one another so dreadfully,”

“ I know And I don*T think I can stand being hurt any more 
** Then,*’ said Miss de Vine, “ I suggest that you stop hurtmg other 
people Face the facts and state a conclusion Bring a scholar’s mind to 
the problem and have done with it ” 

“ I believe you’re quite right,” said Harriet “ I will And that re- 
nunds me Miss Lydgate’s History of Prosody was marked PRESS with 
her own hand this morning I fled with it and seized on a student to take 
it down to the printeis I’m almost positive I heard a faint voice crying 
from the window about a footnote on page 07 — but I pretended not to 
hear ” 

« Well,” said Miss de Vine, laughing, « thank goodness, that piece of 
scholarship has achieved a result at last * ”

ROBERT BURTON 

There was no word from Peter in the mormng The Warden issued 
a bnef and discreet announcement to the College that the offender had 
been traced and the trouble ended The Semor Common Room, recov- 
ering a little from its shock, went quietly about the business of the term. 
They were all normal again They had neVer been anythmg else Now 
that the distorting-glass of suspicion was removed, they were kindly, 
intelligent human beings— -not seeing, perhaps, very much farther 
beyond their own interests than the ordmarv man beyond his job or the 
ordinary woman beyond her own household — ^bul as understandable and 
pleasant as daily bread 

Harriet, having got Miss Lydgate’s proofs off her mind, and feeling 
that she could not brace herself to deal with Wilfnd, took her notes on 
Lefanu, and went dotvn to put in a httle solid work at the Camera 
Shortly before noon, a hand touched her shoulder 
“ They told me you v/eie here,” said Peter ** Can you spare a 
moment ^ We can go up on to the roof” 

Harriet put down her pen and followed him across the ci’^cular 
chamber with its desks full of silent readers 

I understand,” he said, pushing open the swing-door that leads to 



the winding staircase, that the problem is bemg medically dealt 
v/ith ” 

“■ Ob, >es When the academic mind has really grasped a hypothesis— 
which may take a httle time — it copes w^th great thoroughness and 
efficiency Nothing wdl be o\eriooked 
They climbed in silence, and came out at length through the little 
turret upon the galieiy' ot the Camera The previous day^s rain had 
passed and left the sun shining upon a snimng city Stepping cautiously 
over the slatted fiooimg towards the south-east segment of the circle, 
they were a httle suipnsed to come upon Miss Gattermoie and Mr Pom- 
fret, who were seated side by side upon a stone projection and rose as 
they approached, in a flutter, like daws disturbed from a belfry 
“ Don’t move,” said Wimsey, graciously Plenty of room for all of 
us” 

“ It’s quite all right, sir,” said Mr. Po et “ We were just going 
Really I’ve got a lecture at twelve ” 

“ Dear me * ” said Harriet, watching them disappear into the turret 
But Peter had already lost interest in Mr Pomfret and his affairs He was 
leamng with his elbows on the parapet, looking down into Cat Street 
Harriet joined him 

There, eastward, within a stone’s throw, stood the twin towers of All 
Souls’, fantastic, unreal as a house of cards, clear-cut in the sunshine, 
the drenched oval in the quad beneath brilliant as an emerald in the 
bezel of a nng Behind them, black and grey, New College frowmng like 
a fortress, with dark wings wheelmg about her belfry louvres , and 
Queen’s with her dome of green copper , and, as the eye turned south- 
ward, Magdalen, yellow and slender, the tall lily of towers , the Schools 
and the battlemented front of Umversity , Merton, square-pinnacled, 
half-hidden behind the shadowed North side and mounting spire of St 
Mary’s Westward again, Christ Church, vast between Cathedral spire 
and Tom Tower , Brasenosc close at hand , St Aldate’s and Carfax 
beyond , spire and tower and quadrangle, all Oxford spnngmg under- 
foot m living leaf and enduring stone, ringed far off by her bulwark of 
blue hills 


Towery City, and branchy between towers, 

Guckoo-echomg, bell-swarmM, lark-charm6d, 
rook-racked, nver-rounded.

“ Harriet,” said Peter , “ I want to ask your forgiveness for these last 
five years ” 

“ I think,” said Harriet, “ it ought to be the other way round ” 

I think not When I remember how we first met ” 

“ Peter, don’t think about that ghastly tune I was sick of myself, body 
and soul I didn’t know wbat I was doing ” 

342 



** Arjd I chose that time, when I bhotiid have thought only of you, to 
thrust myself upon you, to make demands of you, like a damned arrogant 
fool — ^as though I had only to ask and have Harriet, I ask you to believe 
that, whatever it looked hke, my blundermg was notbmg worse than 
vanity and a blind, childish impatience to get my own way ” 

She shook her head, finding no woids 

“ I had found you/® he went on, a little more quietly, “ beyond all 
hope or expectation, at a time when I thougnt no woman could ever 
mean anything to me beyond a little easy sale and exchange of pleasure. 
And I was so terrified of losing you before I could grasp you that I 
babbled out all my greed and fear as though, God help me, you had 
nothing to think of but me and my wmdy self-importance As though it 
mattered As though the very word of love had not been the most 
crashing insolence a man could offer you 
No, Peter Never that ” 

“ My dear — ^you showed me what you thought of me when vou said 
you would live with me but not marry me ” 

“ Don’t I am ashamed of that ” 

“ Not so bitterly ashamed as I have been If you knew how I have 
tned to forget it I told myself that you were only afraid of the social 
consequences of marriage I comforted myself with pretending that it 
showed you liked me a little I bolstered up my conceit for months, before 
I would admit the humiliatmg truth that I ought to have known from 
the beginmng — that you were so sick of my pestering that you would 
have thrown yourself to me as one throws a bone to a dog, to stop the 
brute from yelping.” 

“ Peter, that isn’t true. It was myself I was sick of How could I give 
you base coin for a marnage-portion ^ ” 

“ At least I had the decency to know that I couldn’t take it in settle- 
ment of a debt But I have never dared to tell you what that rebuke 
meant to me, when at last I saw it for what it was Harriet , I have 
nothing much in the way of religion, or even morality, but I do recognise 
a code of behaviour of sorts I do know that the worst sm — perhaps the 
only sm — ^passion can commit, is to be joyless It must he down with 
laughter oi make its bed in hell— there is no middle way Don’t 
misunderstand me I have bought it, often — ^but never by forced sale or 
at * stupendous sacrifice ’ Don’t, for God’s sake, ever think you 
owe me anything If I can’t have the real thmg, I can make do with the 
mutation But I will not have surrenders or crucifixions If you 
have come to feel any kmdness for me at all, tell me that you would never 
make me that offer again ” 

** Not for anything m the world Not now or at any time since It isn t 
only that I have found a value for myself But when I made you the offer, 
it meant nothing to me — now it would mean somethmg ” 

** If you have found your own value,’* he said, that is immeasurably 

343 



the greatest thing It has laLen me a long time to learn my ies&on, 

Hamet I have had lo pull down, brick by buck, the barriers I had built 
up by my own selfishness and folly If, in all these years, I have managed 
to get back to the pomt at which I ought to have stalled, will you tell me 
so and give me leave to begin again ^ Once or twice m the last few days 
I have fancied that >ou might feel as though this unhappy interval might 
be wiped out and forgotten ” 

No , not tiiat But as though I could be glad to remember it/’ 
Thank you That is far more than I expected or aeserved ” 

‘‘ Peter — it\ not lair to iei you talk bke tins it’s 1 who ought to 
apologise if I owe you nothing else, i owe you my self-respect And I 
ov/e you my life ’’ 

Ah * ” said he, smiimg “ But J have given you that back by letting 
you risk it Thai vvas Jie last kick that sent mv vanity out of doors ’ 

Peter, I did manage to applet late that Mayn’t I be grateful for 
that ’ 

** I don’t want gratitude ” 

** But won’t you take it, now that 1 want to give it you ? 

“ If you feel like that about it, then I have no right to refuse Let that 
clear all scores, Hamet You have given me already fai more than you 
know You are free now and for ever, so far as I am concerned You saw 
yesterday what personal claims might lead to — though I didn’t intend 
you to see it in quite that brutal way But if circumstances made me a 
little more honest than I meant to be, still, I did mean to be honest up to 
a pomt ” 

“ Yes,” said Hamet, thoughtfully. ” I can’t see you burking a fact 
to support a thesis ” 

“ What would be the good ^ What could I ever have gamed by lettmg 
you imagine a he ^ I set out m a lordly manner to offer you heaven and 
earth I find that all I have to give you is Oxford — which was yours 
already Look ’ Go round about her and tell the towers thereof It has 
been my humble privilege to clean and polish your property and present 
her for your inspection upon a silver salver Enter into your hentage and 
do not, as is said in another connection, be afraid with any amaze- 
ment ” 

“ Peter dear,” said Hamet She turned her back upon the shining 
aty, leaning back against the balustrade, and looking at hinn Oh, 
iamn * ” 

“ Don’t worr>%” said Peter “ It’s quite all right By the way, it looks 
as though it was Rome again for me next week But I shan’t leave 
Oxford till Monday On Sunday there’s a Balliol Concert WiU you come 
to It ^ We’ll have one other gaudy mght, and comfort our souls with the 
Bach Concerto for two violins If you will bear with me so far After that, 

I shall be clearing oflf and leaving you to ” 

** To Wilfnd and Co said Hamet, in a kind of exasperation 


344 



** Wilfrid ^ ** said P eter, momentarily at a loss, with his mind seamper- 
ing after rabbits 

“Yes I’m re-writmg Wilfrid ” 

“Good Cxod, yes The chap with the morbid scruples How’s he 
getting on^ ” 

“ He’s better, I think Almost human I shall have to dedicate the 
book to you I think ‘ To Peter, who made W’llfnd what he is ’—that 
sort of thing Don’t laugh like that I’m really working at Wilfrid ” 
For some reason, that anxious assurance shook him as nothing else 
had done 

“ My dear — if anything I have said If you have let me come as 

far as your work and your life Here * I think I’d better remove 
myself before I do anything foolish I shall be honoured to go 
down to posterity in the turn-up of Wilfrid’s trouser You will 
come on Sunday ^ I am dimng with the Master, but I will meet you at 
the foot of the stairs Till then ” 

He slipped away along the gallery and was gone Harriet was left to 
survey the kingdom of the mmd, glittermg from Merton to Bodley, from 
Carfax to Magdalen Tower But her eyes were on one slight figure that 
crossed the cobbled Square, walking lightly under the shadow of St 
Mary’s into the High All the kmgdoms of the world and the glory of 
them 


Masters, undergraduates, visitors , they sat huddled closely together 
on the backless oak benches, their elbows on the long tables, their eyes 
shaded with their fingers, or turned intelligently towards the platform 
where two famous violinists twisted together the fine, strong strands of 
the Concerto in D Mmor The Hall was very full , Harriet’s gowned 
shoulder touched her compamon’s, and the crescent of his long sleeve 
lay over her knee He was wrapt in the motionless austerity with which 
all genuine musicians listen to genume music Harriet was musician 
enough to respect this aloofness , she knew well enough that the ecstatic 
rapture on the face of the man opposite meant only that he was hoping 
to be thought musical, and that the elderly lady over the way, waving her 
fingers to the beat, was a musical moron She knew enough, herself, to 
read the sounds a little with her brains, laboriously unwinding the 
twined chains of melody link by link Peter, she felt sure, could hear the 
whole intricate pattern, every psirt separately and simultaneously, each 
independent and equal, separate but inseparable, moving o\er and 
under and through, ravishing heart and mmd together 

She waited till the last movement had ended and the packed hall was 
relaxing its attention in applause 

“Peter — what did you mean when you said that anybody could have 
the harmony if they would leave us the counterpoint ^ ” 


345 



“ Why/’ said he, shakmg his head, ‘ that I like my music poiyphomc 
If you think I meant anything else, you know what I meant ” 

“ Poiyphomc music takes a lot of playing YoaVe got to be more than 
a fiddler It needs a musician ” 

** In this case, two fiddlers — both musicians ” 

“ I’m not much of a musician Peter ” 

** As they used to say in my youth ‘ All girls should learn a little 
music — enough to play a simple accompamment ’ I admit that Bach 
isn’t a matter of an autocratic virtuoso and a meek accompanist But do 
you want to be either ^ Here’s a gentleman coming to sing a group of 
ballads Pray silence for the soloist But let him be soon over, that we may 
hear the great stndmg fugue again ” 

The final Chorale was sung, and the audience made their way out 
Harriet’s way lay through the Broad Street gate , Peter followed her 
through the quad 

“ It’s a beautiful night — ^far too good tr waste Don’t go back yet 
Come down to Magdalen Bridge and send your love to London River ” 
They turned along the Broad m silence, the light wind fluttering their 
gowns as they walked 

“ There’s something about this place,” said Peter presently, “ that 
alters all one’s values ” He paused, and added a little abruptly “ I 
have said a good deal to you one way and another, lately , but you may 
have noticed that since we came to Oxford I have not asked you to 
marry me ” 

“ Yes,” said Harriet, her eyes fixed upon the severe and delicate sil- 
houette of the Bodleian roof, just emerging between the Sheldoman and 
the Clarendon Building “ I had noticed it ” 

** I have been afraid,” he said, simply , “ because I knew that from 
anything you said to me here, there could be no going back But 

I will ask you now, and if you say No, I promise you that this time I will 
accept your answer Harnet , you know that I love you will you marry 
me?” 

The traflSc lights winked at the Holywell Corner Yes , No , Wait 
Cat Street was crossed and the shadows of New College walls had 
swallowed them up before she spoke 
” Tell me one ttog, Peter Will it make you desperately unhappy if I 
say No ? ” 

“ Desperately ? My dear, I will not insult either you or myself 
with a word like that I can only tell you that if you will marry me it will 
give me very great happiness ” 

They passed beneath the arch of the bndge and out into tlie pale light 
once more, 

** Peter * ” 

She stood still , and he stopped perforce and turned towards her She 

346 



laia both hands upon the fxoots of his gown, looking into his face wMe 
she searched for the word that should carry her over tne last difficult 
breach 

It was he who found it for her With a gesture of submission he bared 
ins head and stood gravely, the square cap dangling m his hand 
Placetne^ magistra ^ ** 

** Placet 

The Proctor, stumping grimly past with averted eyes, reflected that 
Oxford was losing all sense of digmty But what could he do ^ If Senior 
Members of the Umversity chose to stand — ^in their gowns, too f — closely 
and passionately embraemg in New College Lane light under the 
Warden’s windows, he was powerless to prevent it He primly settled his 
white bands and went upon his walk unheeded , and no hand plucked 
his velvet sleeve
